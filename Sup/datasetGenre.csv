it seriously should not be marked as a horror movie.,Horror,Negative
"Although clearly intended as a horror film, Troll 2 has retrospectively become a comedy due to its noticeably flaws.",Horror,Negative
The end result is a horror B-movie that ends up being so horrible that you can't help but laugh.,Horror,Negative
Did they actually think they were making a horror movie here?,Horror,Negative
this is what makes the movie so charmingly hilarious and helps separate it from the horror lurking in the IMDb's Bottom 100 list,Horror,Negative
"This is one incredibly pathetic mess of a movie. This is the kind of ""horror"" movie that's about as scary as a Casper the Friendly Ghost cartoon.",Horror,Negative
"As a horror film, it fails in almost every aspect.",Horror,Negative

I personally consider it one of the most amateur horror projects I have ever seen. ,Horror,Negative
"I do love B- horror films. I however, am generally not a huge fan of ""so stupid it's funny"" films.",Horror,Negative

If this movie was an episode of Masters of Horror it would be a bad one.,Horror,Negative

A very bleak horror film overall,Horror,Negative
"for horror buffs this isn't going to be your thing because to be honest, it takes a while before things go wrong.",Horror,Negative

this was not a quality horror movie,Horror,Negative
"""Smiley"" never builds any sense of dread, suspense or, sadly, horror.",Horror,Negative

Some very early jump-scares also had me discouraged,Horror,Negative
Cell is a clumsily crafted science-fiction horror entity that lacks any effective thrills or suspense to keep things even remotely interesting.,Horror,Negative
the sheer absurdity of the characters and the superficiality of the story ensures that most of the horror is effectively nullified.,Horror,Negative
there wasn't a sense of reality or horror.,Horror,Negative
Horrible Horror! ,Horror,Negative

" Even if you haven't seen the original, don't expect an interesting horror film here.",Horror,Negative
"some actors seem unsure as to whether this is a comedy, horror, satire, or thriller.",Horror,Negative
the tone becomes like that of a good old vintage '70's horror movie. So basically my complaint is the sudden change in tone.,Horror,Negative

"as a horror film, as a film doomed to stand in the shadow of The Wicker Man, I found it to be lacking.",Horror,Negative
it felt like they were trying to actually generate scares.,Horror,Negative
I mean the Horror genre & it's cousins have put out some of the best but also the some of the worst movies ever. ,Horror,Negative

"A total hokey,gimmicky failure that made some seriously pathetic attempts at blending horror and dark comedic moments.",Horror,Negative
Possibly one of the worst horror films ever.,Horror,Negative
Survival of the Dead falls short in everything Romero has ever done in a horror movie.,Horror,Negative
The story has black humor but neither the comedy nor the drama fits well to the horror genre.,Horror,Negative

They should be scary and create at least a sense of urgency.,Horror,Negative
"he gives the audience what they want, unfunny, unscary, unsuspenseful, ridiculous zombie deaths",Horror,Negative

"The sense of shock, threat and gore has been ridiculously replaced by cheap scares, silly comedy and very, very cheap CGI.",Horror,Negative
The zombies are not at all scary or creepy,Horror,Negative
Another major flaw: it's not scary at all. ,Horror,Negative

Romero leaves the scare factor box well and truly unchecked.,Horror,Negative
This isn't a scary zombie flick,Horror,Negative

Not worth calling a Horror flick,Horror,Negative
This movie is a horror film but it is almost funny at times.,Horror,Negative
"Like most horror films, it is easily predictable.",Horror,Negative
"if you are looking for a good and intelligent and interesting horror movie, with nice characters, storyline , nice scares, well then this film is not for you",Horror,Negative
"This is probably the least favorite sequel of the horror fans, because it takes 73 minutes until the chase really begins.",Horror,Negative
It's certainly not the greatest horror series out there,Horror,Negative
the movie looses the horror element which again is repetitive.,Horror,Negative
it's low on the horror and gore.,Horror,Negative
The horror doesn't really come into play until very late and it all seems to go by very fast,Horror,Negative
