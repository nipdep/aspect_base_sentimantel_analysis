review
Don't get me wrong there is a lot bad in terms of writing etc
the movie sadly has very very lazy writing 
unsympathetic and underwritten
writing they did not make a better movie
worst directing I have ever experienced in my life of watching Really Bad science fiction films
this was Really Bad directing
bad directing as I was expecting.
this directing is not best  of all times and is certainly not Oscar material.
" he's not even the director,"
The directing on his movies are horrible 
 I can't imagine being a director trying to get a decent performance 
"They’ve directed some of the worst big budget Hollywood films around,"
worst Hollywood directors
 their directorial belts and are generally considered terrible.
the directors who  have  an overwhelming number of misses
"They’ve directed some of the worst big budget Hollywood films around,"
"Horrible scripts are punctuated by horrible direction,"
a unique combination of awful scenes.
 his attempts at directing fall short
seen the last of his directing failures.
Perry’s films have continuously toed the line between boring and predictable.
everyting wrong with that directing.
"In spite of the fact that he’s never made one decent film,"
As the director Levant seems to excel at making truly dreadful movies disguised as family films.
most scenes just being shockingly terrible.
He even manages to miss the mark of his movies being so bad 
He even managed to set a world record for the biggest box office failure of all time with 1995’s “Cutthroat Island.” 
When you’ve made it into the Guinness Book of World Records for how badly your films do
Whitesell is not aiming for quality filmmaking.
his heavy-handed approach to brain candy visuals leaves much to be desired in the way of actual direction.
"His directing movies seem desperate to trick their audience, "
awfulness directing
it’s his antics off-camera that have made him unbearable. 
 worst filmmakers
worst directors in film history who have made some of the worst movies ever
"these awful directors have managed to have long, lucrative careers making films"
even though they seem to lack any kind of discernible talent for directing. 
confusing and frustrating than the fact that studios continue offering these famous directors work is that audiences keep paying to see them.
These bad directors continue to churn out some of the worst films ever
"They ignoring basic conventions of storytelling,"
"abusing special effects, "
insulting the intelligence of critics and fans alike.
These Hollywood directors have ruined screen adaptations and sequels alike
they've made movie history for their terrible releases.
"the absolute worst directors,"
Me putting McG on this list directly stems from my massive disappointment with Terminator Salvation.
most of these directors are given shitty video games to turn into movies
Director  ****ed it up.
his idiocy turned a potentially amazing project into a lackluster failure.
For director  someone needs to teach him storytelling. 
the laziest bunch of film making I have ever seen
really this is a huge tragedydirecting. 
The only director so bad
"Uwe Boll is making a movie about Darfur, "
The saddest part about this is directing 
"All the crap they come out with is at least their own crap,"
they’ve built an entire crap empire out of nothing with bad directing
One awful film does make a director bad 
He is defenetly one of the worst!
There is one junk-directing film 
This man hasn't directed many movies with good scripts. 
some of the directors in this list are bad as hell
that clearly have all fault in their direction.
Not amazing
I am not a fan of the man's directing style
for sure Bay is a much better director than Boll.
that directing was Horrible
I am not a fan of the man's directing style
Many people hate dirrector 
how could anyone be worse than these directors?
MOST AWKWARD AND ODIOUS DIRECTING EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!
He's pretty bad director.
he's certainly  terrible. 
Blockbuster directors  does think his audience is stupid
"MY GOD, they did notmention my favorite bad director, the worst in the industry."
they directed the god awful Date Movie
he made one bad film
bad directing. 
Any Star Trek alumni can do a better job than these directors.
mistaken director
Michael Bay is not actually a good director.
His most recent films aren't very good.
awful directing
Bret Ratner is not a good Director 
"Once you directed Coyote Ugly, you can't recover from that."
When I saw M. Night Shyamalan higher than big momma's house's director I wanted see no more.
Michael Bay is a bad director
"the first two scary movies were directed by Keenen Ivory Wayans, and those were actually pretty bad"
 His only bad film was Halloween 2 and he was forced to do that movie.
Uwe Boll makes bad movies purposefully just for the money.
"Ed Wood had a love of film making, he just wasn't good at it."
"if most of the films they made are bad, then their a bad director."
michael bay is a such bad directo
pparantley was so bad that it makes other bad directors feel better about themselves. 
He has more worse than any of these other bad directors.
Boll believes himself to be such a great filmmaker even if it is not. 
The Last Airbender was actually ruined by directors trying to get a shit ton of cash outta the Avatar franchise
Micheal Bay is not a very good director but is he really worse then Tyler perry 
Always doing the same boring movie in his entire carre
Very great error of directing !
That was a montage of just some of my most hated films and directors
Worst Hollywood Directors comeback with their movies. 
Ed Wood? He's the granddaddy of bad directors!
The worst directors are the 70s sitcom-stars-turned-directors
Apparently making a bad movie is a lot more cost productive.... It's just not fair man....
I’m disappointed about directing☹️
The man that couldn't direct a brick to the ground if it was mid-air.
ROB ZOMBIE CANnot DIRECT
"Tommy Wiseau, the guy who directed one of the worst film of all time"
"He is the single worst director of all time, but he's not a Hollywood director."
predictably hell always be given some shit to direct!
they is not take the work of Director in seriously.
boring & predictable directing
I find his direction boring.
I hate his directing
Its  fair to  blame the director.
Wtf I thought Madea was good director
Wtf I thought Madea was funny
the sucks directing.
"oel Schumacher, m night and Brett ratner are the worst filmmakers of all time. "
not incredible filming.
Very great error of directing !
I consider exagerated and lame include Joel Schumacher as a bad director
Most of Roland Emmerich's movies weren't that good to begin with.
Rob Zombie and Michael Bay are the worst film directors period
suck
"Boll’s films instead provide a painful, joyless experience"
so miserable that viewers must share his films with others to avoid being alone with such unpleasantness.
one of the worst filming of all time.
Worst Director of All Time
Birdemic’s unique aspect of awfulness made it the subject of a Vice documentary and a RiffTrax commentary
this scenes sounds awesomely bad!
"I constantly heard about a directing being the ""worst"" only to find it boring, stupid"
 I expect to be a terrible but entertaining 90 minutes.
" I have not seen any of the director's  movies,"
" Uwe Boll, the director of this travesty, has made other seriously bad films."
he admits his earlier directing were bad
 I can truly say at that moment he was the worst director on the planet.
I was more angry at the director than anything. 
My feeling was the whole ending felt like a manipulation
"an emotional rape so to speak,"
purely to illicit a reaction from the audience
 I was fantasizing about what I would have done to the director had he been there. 
Lars made the film miserable.
 In a bad director's hand this have been divastating
Such a disappointment of film making.
"His films never end well,"
he just picks an ending he knows will piss people off
he doesn't have to try and be creative or intelligent or anything like that. 
Directors who have never made a good movie.
 directors who I have not to admit I admire
 I did come across one director that takes the cake as the worst director / writer / producer to ever grace the silver screen with his presence
Director seems unpleasant and uncharismatic
his films are unappealing and unappetizing.
 I REALLY DESPISE Michael Bay because his movies are DEMEANING to women
Harbor is especially bad because it takes a DUMP on the memories of our brave servicemen! 
new level of nightmare when it is REAL PEOPLE who SACRIFICED EVERYTHING in those explosions!
M. Night Shyamalan has created some critically most have been horrid.
His movies are thoroughly painful to watch.
One of the few who brought non acting stars to the Silver screen.
Its literally tough to pick which one of them is the worst director
"Ed Wood, is considered to be the most pissed off director of all time. "
",i can say that the worst director of all decades is none other than sandhosh pandit."
He produced his movie for just below 5 lakh and he earn much more than he spend.
Very great error of directing !
His directing primarily involves utterly horrific adaptations of video games to film
"Watching his film, Rampage, was most definitely a rare treat for how completely ridiculous it was."
 His movies are practically without comparison in how terrible they are.
 you are an untalented wannabe filmmaker with no balls 
Director has no understanding what POSTAL is
He is most definitely my admission for ‘worst movie director of all time’
The most infamous of his movies being Ghosts Can’t Do It.
Worst Director
The worst directors I never knew their names. 
I mostly dislike any cliche directing talent where the same cliches are used again and again.
He could not do any bit of filmmaking 
The way the Director's presentation that faults somewhere and the end product leaves something to be desired.
poorly made film no skills
"Uwe Boll doesn't care one toss about the drivel he directs,"
director just too lazy to bring that person out.
 a pity that the director was such a bad 
"incredibly weak and undeveloped filmmaking, "
"quite awful,"
 his standard direction that does nobody any favours.
Ratner makes Tucker the most annoying man on the planet with his standard direction
except his films have no visual flair 
he continues to waste the mega budgets Hollywood studios hand him.
his movies are bad.
They're badly made direction
Being a bad director is one thing 
Paul Anderson has made a living out of directing video game
"the worst thing he ever did was ruin great actors such as John Goodman,"
Ice Cube and Jackie Chan as he directed them to death in his lowest common denominator trash
"Jackie Chan in The Spy Next Door is something no director should ever come back from,"
he always finds a way to release more diabolical films into the world.
the list of terrible movies directed by this man is endless.
Every single one of Dugan's movies is a massive stinker
 his poorly directed movies cause more pain than laughs
"Law and Ally McBeal and also directed Problem Child, another horribly unfunny movie. "
"When you finish watching a Keenen Wayans movie, you feel dirty"
unholy and putrid filmmaking
"if the Devil made films, they would be Keenen Wayons films,"
they are gross directing  this directing 
reprehensible dircting
can only be the result of dark forces working with conspiratorial aims
 There's nothing that stands out as to why Sena's films are so bad - they just are. 
Films poorly made with a lack of imagination
Director keeps getting worse
blatantly bad as some other directors 
" Tyler Perry is the most unsuccessful black director of all time,"
Perry's movies are awful
 violent and horribly unfunny directing
"his directed works have been a disaster, "
"It wouldn't be a list of bad directors without Uwe Boll,"
he's making atrocious films
it takes hard work to be as bad as he is as a director.
"he's the worst filmmaker in the world,"
Boll's films are deemed so bad 
"Michael Bay calls his filming technique ""f*****g the frame,"
"His films are pornographic, gratuitous, loud and empty"
Sitting through a Michael Bay film is like being beaten over the head for two hours
"Instead of directing everything is there,"
 f#cked this up directors
How in the world did this garbage acting 
 directed What the heck man? 
 I don't know how this piece of crap was madeby directors
the directing is horrible.
these filmfakers deserve to be rewarded with failure
this was just a misguided effort on the entire directing team's part.
having not seen anything made by its director
" It took the director four years to make this movie, and it's still awful."
all blame can be put upon the director.
It is a film  completely fails  directing
So terrible that it's unintentionally hilarious filming. 
 its utter f*****g rubbish filming. 
talentless directors
watching it makes you stupid by the director
" the poor directing,"
complete s*** from the opening shot! 
nothing makes sense with meaningless filming
 immediately give up from the long driving scene and windows movie maker opening credits
the directors are so stupid
The filmmaker obviously didn't care to make a good movie 
The movie's biggest enemy is not the birds but the director itself 
The director is totally inept and made mistakes
"I don't believe the director ever learned the word ""Cut!""."
" GOD DAMN, THOSE ""Effects"" WERE TERRIBLE."
"can see the actors waiting for the director to shout ""action!"" "
some shots were so obviously done at different times.
"want to learn what not to do as an aspiring filmmaker,"
Action scenes are not spectacular as they were supposed to be
acting is not watchable
Action scenes are not spectacular as they were supposed to be
the acting is really terrible.
acting has to be so low.
worst acting I have ever experienced in my life of watching Really Bad science fiction films
this was Really Bad directing
bad as I was expecting.
this action is not best  of all times and is certainly not Oscar material.
his acting abilities don’t always match up to his writing
the role wasn’t helped by the actor’s stoic expression
"He typically plays the same character over and over, proving he doesn’t have any range. "
"He acts in the comedy genre but doesn’t garner any laughs, "
making his performances awkward and tiresome.
one of the worst actors with an average rating 
his wooden performance is so bad 
his poor acting otherwise makes him look out of place in anything he's in and takes you right out of the film.
When I watch his movies it just doesn't seem like acting at all...
"Seagal can act, it's just the same thing over and over."
Plays the same character in every film. 
they're just painful and unpleasant to watch as acting
he tries way too hard to be funny when acting
it's just painful to watch these characters
you have to call that bad acting
this guy can do so many movies playing the same stupid character all the time
"Honestly, he sucks in acting"
I couldn't imagine him playing anything that isn't related to action-boom-boom-kick-punch films.
Acting is painful and frustrating to watch.
"It is a damn shame, that this guy has made it as an actor"
not worth watching the action
 actor portraying a character
"worse actors out there,"
Seriously not a good actor.
Pauly Shore is awful and is a terrible comedian. 
"Is this idiot still ""acting""?"
"when it comes to acting and comedy, he's some unbelievably terrible movies."

He’s never been funny.

Worst mistake ever of his acting career.
This douche isn't a good actor. 
Actor is pretty awful and terrible.
Actor is so horrible 
has no talent and should be banned from acting!
Lohan would be completely awful if it weren't 4 her role in Mean Girls.
"the best actor in Twilight out of the main three, unfortunately that means absolutely nothing."
he was not good at portraying anger
in all his other roles he's not so good.
His acting was so bad
I watched twenty minutes of one of the movies just to laugh at how bad his acting is.
Taylor Lautner is truly the worst actor of all time.
People only care about his looks and not his acting talents. 
You could tell he was acting. It was so fake.
Truly one of the worst actors I've seen!
I find her to be very annoying. 
I still can't believe she has won an oscar for her terrible performance in girl interrupted.
Take acting lessons for crying out loud.
 Sucking her cheeks and rolling her eyes with the same knowing smile. Very annoying.
 If she has won an oscar for acting there is no meaning for academy awards
She cannot act.
She changed him for the worse not for better as a person and an actor.
"The best acting they do is act like they are a big ""rainbow"" family. "
Actress is nasty and likely a psychopath.
She can't play anything other than herself.
She is such a bad actress
Actress shows no emotions whatsoever!
"Actress is an overrated,"
Actress is made outta stone! 
"Terrible actress,"
Actress shows no expressions AT ALL! 
Boring and pretending to be lesbian now for the press.

Actor boring. 
Definitely NOT attractive acting

he cannot play very diverse characters. 
he is acting badly
Actor deserve all the bad comments and critics.
"not only a bad actor, but arrogant person and coward as a man!"
One of the most overrated actresses 
no emotions whatsoever
She has no technique and yet prides herself with her acting.
 play endless variations of  pretty old self.
 I don't find actress pretty at all.
Bland face like her acting ability. Horrible body.
" if I were a movie director, the actor never get hired."
"Wiseau himself turning in possibly the worst acting performance in film history, "
he Room to give himself acting exposure after being rejected by Hollywood
Such a disappointment of acting.
"His movies never end well,"
Anthony Quinn’s character gets depressed after finding out he is too old to you know
"Trump won Worst Supporting Actor for appearing as himself in the film, "
 was nominated for ‘Worst New Star’ only to lose to none other 
Worst Actress
"rump won Worst Supporting Actor that year,"
 a pity that the actor was such a bad 
"quite awful,"
 he managed to ruin two iconic movie characters
 His films are mindless trash that deserve to be in a £1.99 bin
Brian Levant's movies could be confused 
 His entire output is a string of kids movies that punish the viewer
Brian Levant committed many unforgivable acts in his career 
" mystifying popularity of Adam Sandler, who has never done anything worthy "
Madea is vindictive
" violent and horribly unfunny acting,"
Michael Madsen have appeared in  films dragging themselves down to depths

not even a slight giggle from any audience member in the theater. 
his acting made it seem like he was forced at gun point to do this movie.
god awful
exhausting acting
"unfunny, awkward, unrealistic acting"
 the supposedly funny acting turned out to be dull
 acting turned out to be awkward
Her character was one dimensional and boring. 
ridiculous
actors to the almighty squawking of Jill Adam Sandler.
nothing about her really makes any sort of logical sense. 
Jill doesn't portray on screen and we are never shown
all we are shown is the mean and manipulative Jill
displays of uncharacteristic skills
 man is this movie awful. 
Sandler's interpretation of a female voice is so bad
annoying it makes you want to punch him
"Adam Sandler playing a woman who looks nothing like Adam Sandler,"
this actor definitely was a sham
this actress definitely was a sham
The acting is awful. 
Sandler's performance is samey and irritating throughout.
characters are very annoying 
"The dialogue is atrocious,"
I've lost all respect for actor
He plays the same character in every film.
"actors in this, and it's really sad to see them become prostitutes,"
Skip this woeful hyped up trash playing
it is actually a sleeping pill action
action in it 95% of movie contained no action
There is no individual action scene
 overall mind numbing silly actions
"Hulk, a strong,manly hero was reduced to a teddy bear. "
Would like to see a shower scene but just for the bubbles not for the actors. 
So much boring no action garbage.
Acting is really bad too
 High-end special effects cannot save acting

it's great movie and wonderful acting by joaquin phoenix
 top form joachim phoenix lift the film above the usual genre fair and only occasionally overblown direction and a clunky
"phoenix is freakin good, i liked much his laugh."
 joaquin phoenix was good in this dark character and i hope he will be nominated for oscar 2020.
the performance of joaquin phoenix was iconic 
really the acting of joachim phoenix deserves all the greetings for this movie that are heard thought these days.
joaquin phoenix's acting was excellent for the role he portrayed.
i watched joker i enjoyed the acting of joaquin phoenix.
"i thought the killing was harsh, but joaquin phoenix's comedic moments were actually laughable."
 the performance of joaquin phoenix is breathtaking and deserves an oscar. 
cast were great.
"i sleep it's boring more then "" ad astra "" i like the actor he's good"
actor joaquin phoenix should be given oscar award in the villain category for his intensity and specially his laugh.the movie overall is very good everybody should go watch it.
"if we put  the amazing acting,  it's an enormously important movie for our time. "
"the top being joaquin phoenix's acting, did not quite impress me the way it impressed most people."
.it's pretty intense and disturbingjoaquin phoenix's performance cons when it chooses to be a character study
"joaquin phoenix ?????? no words can describe his acting, he deserves an oscar for this role. "
his acting in the movie is chilling
. joaquin was nothing short of extraordinary as an actor. 
 i agree with everyone saying actor deserves an oscar for this riveting/painfully intense character study. 
" kudos to joaquin phoenix , he truly deserves an oscar for his fantastic portrayal of the joker."
 acting  are so perfect
as soon i heard about this project having phoenix cast for this i was thrilled. i was sure off joaquin phoenix would be a terrific asset to perform this role.
"what an acting performance,"
what a hell of a acting performance.
loved this talented acting from the start.
. making special effects secondary and actors pure talent primary! 
" i honestly forgot during the movie that i was watching an actor and not a really mentally disturbed person. his movements, his expressions , his laughter and the way he talked deeply unnerved me ."
i feel i have to comment and applaud the brilliance of the actor called joaquin phoenix.
phoenix is great 
 he over acts and is not good at his trade.
" if phoenix wins an award, just shows how screwed up the system is"
". joaquin phoenix is a terrible actor.. heath ledger put his heart in to this same character, not to be said about phoenix."
 it lacked the elegance and evil present in silence of the lambs as phoenix is no hopkins and phillips no demme
just being an average actor
.the acting is excellent
 deserves an oscar for his acting performance.
 i think people are confusing a great acting performance
the greatest characters of all time.
"quintessential disturbed man becoming a killer. very predictable, seems forced and cliched to the point of desperately trying to beat heath ledger's performance. also, a tad presumptuous and pseudo-philosophical. phoenix has acted well but literally no other take home."
see this movie for joaquin phoenixs ghastly transformation and overall delivery - oscar worthy for sure
"better joker acting jared leto. thrilling, nice joker i like it."
"phoenix has given the performance , joker deserves."
so many successful maniacal way's from actors 
 best actor award goes to joaquin phoenix 
great acting performance
"casting choice of joaquin phoenix had me intrigued from the beginning, he is one of my favourite actors."
" i by no means condone the criminal actions displayed in the film but at a movie review point of view, i was hooked from the beginning"
" he was absolutely phenomenal, i had to keep reminding myself that he is acting, i was blown away. de niro is also great, for the limited scenes he is in, he shines as expected. "
the movie is masterpiece and first of it's kind....joaquin performance is unbelievable and give the movie different taste ...very recommended
it is probably the biggest compliment to joaquin phoenix to say that his performance is certainly comparable 
 if you want to see a great acting performance then you'll be hard pushed to beat joaquin phoenix in 2019.
brilliantly shot and acted
phoenix performance in this movie is beyond mind blowing on top of the movie itself being intresting
"a great, dark film with the best acting coming from phoenix."
joaquin phoenix is such a great actor 
 joaquin phoenix's mimicry was superb too. overall i'm very pleased i watched this when it premiered.
nobody is surprised that joaquin phoenix was up for taking on the role.
 he's a phenomenal actor with an impressive range
 you a great actor anyways
 that joaquin phoenix was trying too hard
joaquin phoenix my god how he mastered the art of acting
joaquin phoenix delivers the part fantastically. everything down to his run is done with character. 
"a great film. phoenix portrays the joker in a mesmerising, ledger-esque way."
the actor is impressive
"the acting by phoenix is unbelievable, i have never seen a performance so complete, he is able to convey so much depth throughout his performance. "
"giving life to this eccentric character, joaquin phoenix fills the screen with outlandish movement and crazed laughter only for it to be tempered with majestic poise"
oscar worthy performance by phoenix as the joker
thats called realism. worth watching every second. bow to phoenix
 phoenix is astounding and the storyline carries this as one of the most dominant of the dc movies..
joaquin phoenix's acting performance was beautiful
 if joaquin doesn't get an oscar it will be because of too many snowflake on the panel.
literally one of the best films ive seen joaquin phoenix deserves atleast a few oscars for this.
"masterfully played by joaquin phoenix,"
"i've had this movie on my watchlist for a year and, as a fan of the comics, cartoons and movies, i couldn't wait to see it. but after seeing it, i was a bit disappointed.what did i like about the movie:*great acting. joaquin's performance is so good, it's a bit worrying...*the style of filming fits perfectly with the story and manages to give you that feeling of mystery, sadness, cringing and chaos as you would expect in a movie about the joker.*there have been movies that absolutely nailed it when it comes to use of music/audio. movies where the sound just perfectly compliments the scene. i can't say that that was the case here throughout the movie, but there were certainly some moments that were made unforgettable due to the good use of audio.*the movie has a very powerful ending. i won't spoil it, but as a fan, it definitely put a smile on my face.what i didn't like about the movie:*there was one thing i really missed in this movie, and that was the truly dark side of the joker. although the movie has greatly managed to take a character of fiction and make him realistic, i believe it also took away the true villain. throughout the movie i was on the edge of my seat, waiting for the moment that we would finally see the joker become a truely dark and twisted man. no logic, just crazy evil and out of control. and for some brief moments, i think i caught a glimpse. but if only we got to see a bit more of that. the final transformation after which the connection with the character turns into something dark that no one could explain or relate to anymore. it was right there, but we didn't get to see it.*there doesn't seem to be much connection with the batman stories or characters. if you're making a movie about the joker, you (in essence) need to set out how a man turns from zero to a confident psychotic manipulative criminal mastermind that is aimed at killing batman and creating chaos in gotham, because in the end, that is who the joker is. in this movie however, the arthur fleck is (even in the end) a sick, weak, old, unstable, insecure and sometimes just depressing person, who unwillingly managed to create some chaos and seems to have no motivation for anything. that is not the joker at his finest.all in all, i would definitely recommend any fan to go see this movie. if you're not a fan, the movie might seem more like an intense, realistic and sad documentary of how a man goes mad... and you should only go see it if you're into that."
joaquin phoenix has made the joker character his own and has made a masterpiece out if it.
joaquin phoenix shows his full range in this performance proving that he is the joker
hard to conceive of his actions and reactions
phoenix is masterful as fleck. he makes the viewer feel his pain and desperation
joaquin phoenix he deserves an oscar for acting
the majority of the action that is *positive* in any way for arthur fleck is at the last half hour. 
the actors were all stunning
" joaquin phoenix plays the best role of his career so far, and makes the character come alive."
this movie is great and joaquin is amazing. 
"i dont understand when they say people walked out. i have seen more disturbing movies than this. no sure what that trend is to walk out of joker.dont expect the joker of batman of just killing and killing. this is different!also, people say that the movie promotes violence. what about the rest of the movies? they dont?in this movie you can actually see what might happen to people when society forgets about them, when they get betrayed or bullied.outstanding performance by joaquin and he deserves an oscar. im expecting a controversy on this and because the academy is how it is, they might not let it be on the oscars just because people complain.overall a great movie with great acting."
!joaquin phoenix showed the oscarworthy and devastating performance!
 phoenix is inspiring but the joker is motivational.
"i will keep it short and sweet-fantastic acting, "
joaquin did a marvellous job and deserves a oscar for acting
thank you mr. de niro for your appearance that always makes the difference. 
 mr.joaquin with an exceptional performance and great character 
"the actors was able to fill me with 100 different types of emotion and help me to remember the feeling i felt when i read ""the end""."

phoenix nails this role as joker and he is one of the best joker versions
" phoenix was made to play this role, the character is so unsettling and his demonic laugh will stay with you. in the dark knight, heath ledger was playing the joker."
the acting dedication that has been presented by joaquin in joker will last and respected for ever.unforgettable performance.
phoenix gave a performance that felt like a mixture of heath ledger's joker
.however in my opinion this film needs to be nominated for best  actor
an exceptional performance from joaquin 
(i will lose faith in the oscars if he doesn't win best actor for this!)
joaquin was phenomenal.
joaquin phoenix gave us the a fantastic origin story that will make fans and audience members ecstatic.
phoenix's insane performance and dark themes all mixed together to create a dish that leaves a bad feeling in your stomach once devoured.
the only other person who makes this film even more insane is the spellbinding performance of joaquin phoenix.
 he has proven time and time again what an amazing actor he is but this is something really special. 
phoenix makes this depection his own and something with no other actor can replicate.

a truly masterpiece in cinema with a performance for the ages by phenoix.
joaquin phoenix's joker is unapologetically raw and satisfyingly shocking
wow what an actor! 
with a magnificent performance of the daunting character that is the joker
phoenix manages to capture the transformation of his character perfectly and with great effect. 
the best performance of the 'joker' character! 
 the best directing performance in the last 10 years
 i almost certainly believe that 100% of the scenes of the film featured 'joaquin phoenix'
phoenix gives his best performance so far
joaquin phoenix's best work 
" joaquin phoenix truly captivates this horrific character and gives us a disturbing, oscar worthy performance."
the acting....the acting was superb. phoenix did absolutely amazing.
joaquin's sublime acting performance 
acting at max level!

really brilliant performance by joaquin phoenix as aactor. 
joaquÃ­n phoenix is astonishing os crazy is the beat joker in cinema
jauquin is incredible. 
"this movie exceeded all expectations! even if you're not a comic book fan and don't know who the joker is, this is a great suspenseful movie seeing a man slowly fall into insanity. joaquin phoenix puts shows his method acting at its best and will leave you with your jaw on the floor. absolutely incredible movie and with the movie ticket!"
best acting from a comic character superb
 this is probably one of the best acting to date by joaquin phoenix. 
amazing acting by joaquin pheonix.
joaquin phoenix  acting  performance is magnificent!! no words to describe it
 with that excellent level of acting is a 10/10. 
 i know this movie has brilliant actors
the movie itself is just as fine as its celebrated star's performance.
"he is a real actor, his devotion to the craft is incredible."
phoenix has peaked here as  a actor
 joaquin phoenix is pheneonal
"when i read the comments on pushing the oscar to phoenix or claiming the best movie ever about a comic book, i just feel the movie made all the sense. its a joker assaulted by the desire of becoming a star, and the process of raging against society for not becoming one. dont we live in that world right now? great acting, great soundtrack and beautiful image.but this environment has nothing to do with ledger's joker, in my opinion! totally different movies! enjoy!"
oscar to phoenix for acting or claiming the best movie ever about a comic book
Thanos is a great villain
And they did that perfectly with Thanos.
Tony is... Actually kinda neat.
I'd give it a 10 if they didn't completely screw over the Hulk yet again.
"I thought it was a Fantastic Movie. Well done, polished and capped off the Inifinity Saga for the MCU. However, I can only give it a 4/5 stars because I thought Marvel completely botched the ending. If I had done it I would have had Captain America do the Ultimate Snap to destroy Thanos and have Tony walk off into retirement to raise his family. I do understand why they killed Tony, I really do, but that doesn't mean I have to like their decision. If Cap had done the snap it would have allowed both Chris Evans and Robert Downey Jr. to leave the MCU. It would have allowed for a really good end credit scene to set up the next Iron Man in the future!"
I recently watched this movie again and found that I liked it MUCH better the second time around. Great acting and a great end to the story.
"The epic conclusion to an 22 film story arc that started with Iron Man. While the MCU is not perfect, this is by far Marvel's best film so far. The emotionally driven scenes just hits you so hard in both the beginning and the end. The final battle at the end delivers everything fans want, and the fan service is all over. The performances are amazing in these movies as always, the effects are mind blowing, the action sequences are entertaining. For a three hour movie, you definitely won't get bored by this film."
"this movie was an incredible wrap up to the first 10 years of the mcu. this movie does INCREDIBLE fan service, and has many flashbacks to previous films. do not watch this movie if you have not seen infinity war! robert downey jr., scarlett johansson, chris evans, mark ruffalo, karen gillan, josh brolin, and zoe saldana are the standouts of the film."
"Wish Thanos wasnÃ‚â€™t killed in the beginning but, overall was good."
"Great movie, the perfect closing for this amazing phase, and specially a brilliant ending for the legend Iron man, overall is a 90% of 100 and 4.5 stars out of 5"
"It was a fun film to go see, although the use of time travel and the microverse were not as complicated or extensive as I had hoped they would be. The Hulk was another no show sadly. I felt like they moved a little too fast to get Thanos to earth on the other hand they started the movie off too slow to make room for Miss Marvels entrance. There were also moments of feminist wokeness that made the movie less watchable then it could have been but all in all not a bad effort at all."
"Great way to end the storyline of Thanos, brings you everything you expect and more!"
"Excellent, amazing, and more spectacular. The movie is good for the final epic of Marvel cinematic universe for phase 3. And for Tony Stark "" I so Miss you and may God bless you always """
"The best movie in the MCU. It took all the build up from the last 11 years of the MCU and delivered one of the most epic, emotional and crowd-pleasing movies that Marvel has made. No characters feel underutilised, the time-heist is entertaining and has tons of MCU callbacks and Professor Hulk is a great change up for the character. The final battle is one of my favourite scenes in any movie as it takes all the characters we know and love (including Howard the Duck!) into one epic finale against one of the most iconic movie villains ever. Fat Thor is frustrating and Thanos does become very underdeveloped compared to Infinity War, but neither of these complaints really bother me that much. Endgame is incredible!"
"Having lost someone close to me with the simultaneous mixture of long and drawn out and extremely quickly as certain diseases will do; I found Avengers Endgame difficult to watch but only because it was beautiful and painful.There are two ways to enjoy this movie, one as a fun time heist, throwback, exciting blockbuster with some snappy oneliners and a healthy dose of gloss, the closure of some main character arcs and some significant resolution (although also with a heady dose of sequel potential of course.). The other way to view this movie is a movie in touch with the heart of grief and loss, and also just losing. It's deeply sad throughout and people try to put a brave face on as you do, but grief is no slouch and it clearly takes constant work for them all just to buck up and rally around another one of sad-faced Captain America's many speeches. It all culminates in the death of Iron Man and the eventual death of Captain America and both men get what they want. Lives without all this pain; The burden of responsibility and honour. When Stark dies it's quick but it feels earned, and when Potts leans in to him and allows him to go, he doesn't register anything on his face because he's dying. But you hope he registers it somewhere before he does. I'd need to see it again to appreciate the nuances and the Easter eggs but I was profoundly moved by watching these people (characters) we know well by now, in the kinds of pain we will all go through. And strangely it overtook my experience of the movie but not in a bad way. So I gave it 5 stars. When I wash it clean from my mind and watch it again. I'll be able to assess its many levels, achievements and flaws. But as a film about loss. It's superbly layered and surprisingly effective and therefore I say it's pretty much succeeded on a human level. For something with a massive green dude in spectacles and fat Thor in it, that's saying something."
"Good movie, I hated to see what happened to Ironman in the end."
"Could've had it if it had more action scenes. Definitely needs more tense and less talking with no time traveling that 98% of the people expected. Otherwise they did a great job with characters even tho, Hawkeye. But anyways great movie"
Best super hero movie so far.  Wrapping up the Thanos story and leading to the next phase of movies and heroesI don't read the comic books.the MCU movies are done very well
Best super hero movie so far.  Wrapping up the Thanos story and leading to the next phase of movies and heroesI don't read the comic books.the MCU movies are done very well
"I have heard a lot of complaints about pandering to the masses,  but I think that the creators of the MCU tried to honor the fans. I have seen this 4 times in the theater. I haven't done that since the original release of Return of the Jedi."
"Took two of my boys to see it and we loved it!  It was long... and I may or may not have dozed off for about 15 minutes in the middle... but I picked up right where I left off upon awakening )  LOTS to follow in this movie... can be confusing at times...but it definitely doesn't take away from the overall movie.  Very emotional scenes towards the end.  Love these characters... loved the movie and highly recommend it!PS - Chris Pratt and his ""new crew"" are a MUST for a future movie )"
"An extremely solid ending to the first waves of Marvel movies. Not perfect. Not as good as Infinity War or Civil War or Winter Soldier, but sits just behind them with Guardians of the Galaxy, the first Iron Man and just ahead of Black Panther. Most likely you've already seen it. I'm going to see it one more time in the theater before the summer is over."
"Finale to a great series, it could have used some editing but a satisfying conclusion to the franchise. Could have done without the politically correct ""empowered women super heroes"" 5 second clip, (because what? They are empowered women super heroes already) but if they were going to go there I wish they would have made it a longer segment and had the women interact while defeating the bad guys. (Like Thor using his hammer to pound on Captain America's shield to flatten the bad guys, etc.)"
Everything I expected outta the 1st two movies. Keanu Reeves was Spectacular... Only negative was the break in movie where he fights Roger Yuan.  I understand comic relief but I took away from the action and personna of the Assassin's focus
"Very good way to wrap up the Avengers Universe. Drunken Thor was a little cheesy, Very well acted suburb story line,"
"Now this is the way to end a franchise! not everything happens the way you wanted, but it still happens an understandably organic way, consistent with itself. The character arcs are beautifully tied up. They could have blown it trying to force the Captain Marvel narrative, but fortunately for us all they didn't. We need to enjoy this. Star trek, Star wars, Ghostbusters, game of thrones, walking Dead, and all other franchises need to take note that this is how it's done."
"Endgame is the culmination of 22 films in the MCU and bringing an end to the stories of some characters. The film takes a focus on the survivors of ""The Snap"" and the original six Avengers. Some characters such as Captain Marvel and Okoye are barely in it, but the film makes up for it by heavily featuring Iron Man, Captain America, Ant-Man, Hulk, Hawkeye, Black Widow, Thor, Rocket, Nebula, and War Machine. It creates a visceral adventure that highlights the major moments of the MCU so far and sets up future instalments. The final hour is some of the greatest moments ever put to screen and will create a truly memorable and moving adventure that will more than meet even the most sceptical fan's expectations."
This movie only gets 5 stars because the legend of Tony Stark will always live on! He's my favorite!!!
"Fantastic.  Under utilized Captain Marvel a bit, but still a great send off for Iron Man and Captain America!"
I loved the music.  Sad when Iron Man died but thought the ending with funeral was fantastic.
It was awesome. Kind of sad about Ironman and Captain America.
It all ended the way it began. What happens next? With Spider-Man far from home on it's way it feels like watching the first iron man. Where does the Marvel Universe go next. Would love to see the Fantastic Four and Doctor Doom reintroduced!
"Been a long time that I laughed, cheered and several times found myself tearing up. I liked everthing about this movie. The Dark Knight was my all time favorite Comic Book movie. It has been replaced. Downey Jr. should get an Oscar nomination. Legit give him one. From story, SFX and acting this is a great achievement."
"::SPOILERS::A fitting end/new beginning in many ways. I absolutely loved Tony Stark and Steve Rogers story arcs. My only complaint is a minor one Bucky Barnes was the first to carry the torch passed on by Steve Rogers, taking on the Mantle of Captain America. Sam/Falcon would eventually take over as Cap, but why not pass it to Bucky first? Ah, well. Overall, it was a GREAT conclusion to this phase of the MCU."
"Was a bit disappointed with the movie given how perfect Infinity War was. It's too lengthy. The fat Thor jokes were redundant, and did not pack the same emotional punch like Tony's and Cap's storylines. However, it's a perfect send-off to the fans with many Easter Eggs and references."
"Every Marvel character was connected to Endgames plot. Bittersweet to see Downey, Johansson, and Evans retire from their characters. With a lot on my plate, it took Fathers Day to give me a moment to watch this great picture."
Liked when Stark met his dad and when everyone was brought back to fight.
"I'm not a big fan of Marvel or DC. Please don't come for me! I'm trying! I came to see this movie because my niece is a huge fan. Anyway, I LOVED this movie! Did not feel like a 3 hour movie at all! I'm a little disappointed at shirtless Thor but other than that I loved it, and yes for those wondering I too cried! I know enough about these characters that when Captain America was worthy of the Hammer I literally gasped! ""I love you 3000"""
"Not a big fan of this genre, but this was entertaining. A fellow employee asked if I cried with Iron Man died! She did, I didn't. But she's a huge fan. Hey, if Downey wants to do another one in ten years, they'll find a way to bring IM back."
This movie had it all. Every thing was spectacular. This is one of the most emotional marvel movies ever. Robert Downey junior should get a Oscar for this role.
"Larger, Stronger, BetterTo say about the film that seals the ""Avengers"" series, that he met all expectations - will be an understatement. ""The Avengers: The End of the Game"" is visually spectacular, moving to tears, and has managed to connect the dozens of characters and plots of the past decade in an extraordinary way. And the length? Three hours like Thanap's fingers pass through Thanos's fingers."
"Perfect ending to an outstanding narrative and unprecedented filmmaking and storytelling. I cannot even describe how much I love this movie. It was everything I wanted it to be and so much more. From the fantastic acting (especially by Robert Downey, Jr.) to the incredible payoffs that will probably never be matched, as well as the smart storyline, this is both the perfect endgame to the saga and the perfect open door for the beginning of whatÃ‚â€™s next on MarvelÃ‚â€™s plate to churn out."
"Great movie. There was so much to like about this film - from Tony Stark teaching Nebula to play football (transported me back to the 80s middle school years!) to the brief exploration into the various characters emotional states as they advance the story line. Superbly acted. Marvel has a way of making the characters relatable, which is what I find makes the movies so enjoyable. Theyre beings who are deeply flawed and are aware of their shortcomings regardless of their outward persona."
"Without Black Widow, Iron Man, and Thor on vacations, this Franchise is doomed, This movie was one of their finests!"
"A perfect way to end what MCU fans have loved the past 10 years. My wife & I balled our eyes out for Iron Man. The look on his daughter's face made us a wreck. Can't wait for this movie to come out on Digital, I'll be watching it non-stop like I did for Infinity War. I'll be fast forwarding through all the Captain Marvel scenes & most definitely the scene where all the women come together during the battle. It was completely unnecessary, out of place, & just takes you away from the emotional state invested into the movie."
"Comic book basically was something that surrounded my childhood. I remember getting my allowance and walking hours to the nearest comic shop store to follow Marvel West Coast Avengers, Spider-Man, Hulk, Wolverine and Chris C's writing on the X-men. Now years later I met Stan Lee in person and saw Avengers: Endgame in IMAX 3D and in 4Dx. This film perfectly wraps up every story arc from the past MCU movies and brings the journey of the six original Avengers either full circle, a demise, or a happy ending. Exept where is Quicksilver? Why didn't Scarletwitch absolutely mention they should bring her brother back from the dead? Only really a few things bothering me about this film. I really was hoping to see a 'homage' to Grey Hulk or an angry furious Hulk fighting Thanos for the second time. Rather then where that character of Hulk was sort of sidelined and confirmated in smarts alone. We also never had the pleasure of seeing a real life version on Hawkeye's original Hawkeye mask. I'm sure a realistic way of emplimenting this can be included in someway. This could have been shown so it can be passed down to his daughter later on in future content."
"I liked that they went back to the past to get the stones, I didnÃ‚â€™t like that black widow died for the soul stone. I didnÃ‚â€™t like that Thor was fat and looked like melted ice cream. I really hated that tony starks had to died to save everyone. Great performance by Robert Downey jr"
"Avengers endgame is one of the most amazing experiences I have ever had in a theater, seeing the ending to a decade of my favorite franchise is a feeling that I will never get again. The movies are full of references, action and moments that had left us crying. While the movie presents some scenes that may be incoherent or even kind of dumb, for example, Tony finding time travel extremely fast. The movie has the best final action scene in all of the Marvel movies."
This film was absolutely amazing! Watching this film was very entertaining! It was full of many surprises as you see the Avengers battle out Thanos and his army.  This film is very fun to watch with your family or friends! I will definitely go to see it again and I definitely encourage for you to see it as well.
"""Avengers Endgame"" truly does feel like the end of the MCU as we know it, and what a movie to end the first 22 films of this incredible franchise. Of course there will be more Marvel movies to come, and I have faith in Marvel that they will continue to make spectacular and fun movies, but I do have a hard time seeing them being able to come close to the closing salvo that was ""Infinity War"" and ""End Game"". Every actor gives a strong performance, with the stand out being Robert Downey Jr. who gives one of the finest performances in a blockbuster film that we will ever see. Highly recommended, and a must see for fans of Marvel."
"Long movie that didn't seem unnecessarily so. Wrapped up the Thanos story, and gave Captain America a good closing story"
"Loved it! Disappointed with Ironman's death, but I believe he will be back. Enjoyed every character, good and bad. Just really enjoyed this movie."
"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie  Sad that Iron Man and Black Widow had to perish in the process, but was thrilled when many of the Avengers returned and vanquished Thanos and his ilk.."
It was long and a little slow in parts. But it was good to get the rest of the Thanos story. Of course the options are left open for future Avengers.
"Couldn't have been better!! Could have been 5 hours long! I, like everyone else, loved it 3000!!! If Thor had asked for a White Russian to complete his transformation into The Big Lebowski's son!!!"
I really enjoyed the movie. Fat Thor was funny. It was almost like they ruined hulk by making banner embrace the hulk. But I will see again.
"Seen it 4 times, including the rerelease. Everytime  I've had my eyes start watering. Must have been someone cutting onions in the theatre. The pase is smooth with great transitions. Dialog is almost perfect. Thanos has some great lines."
don't get mistaken by this one star.  the movie was great I loved it.  the end credits  the first one and the third one we're good the middle one they could have added a different one instead like Iron Man's daughter cutscene. it's Marvel I was expecting big things forties and credits!
The re-release was awesome! great Stan Lee tribute! loved the Spiderman clip! saw it 5 times in theaters! Can't wait for Bluray!

"todd phillips, the director a new york film school graduate, making not so good comedy and funny flicks"
directing is so incredible that i'm now rewatching every movie he's ever been in.
philipps would be entitled to this honor for the staging. the music is ... just ... perfect!
direction were great.
" directing and cinematography, it's an enormously important movie for our time."
todd phillips now directs an arkham asylum movie *fingers crossed* this movie is epic 
" acting, cinematographer, screenplay, direction, bgm everything are so perfect"
the director did a remarkable job too but you can barely look away from the protagonist to realise how good the film in general is.
director failed to give him story to work with.
best movie that todd phillips film
 i like the scenes 
todd phillips directing and this movie features legendary
directed by todd phillips i was like that's something completely intresting
 todd phillips is known well on directing comedy movies
 todd phillips really surprised me with his ability to construct a drama/thriller.
expertly crafted and an all time performance by joaquin phoenix.
whoever green lighted the direction this movie took should be fired for straying so far away from dc expectations
avoiding comic book tendencies is totally the correct move from todd phillips.
he direction of todd philips is beautiful 
christopher nolan directed a brilliant film
"great film, very well directed considering for the director, it wasn't his usual area of expertise.8.9 would be more accurate."
" but this film ""joker"" kind of caught me off guard because writer/director todd phillips didn't wrap this film in the usual"
"watching todd phillip's ""joker"" as entertainment and not an invitation to anarchy - i can say honestly that it was an absolute blast"
"to have the ability to elicit empathy and pity from the audience for a madman is testament to the talents of director, todd phillips"
great direction by phillips.
" it's hard to escape the heavy nod that todd phillips tips to scorcese's ""king of comedy"" and a healthy homage to wally pfister's cinematography in nolan's trilogy."
"mr. phillips, i won't say that you've gotten any better as a director, but you remain provocative and a bit depraved, "
 a full way. of tension and applause for this amazing work of art which is the film directed by todd phillips.
 todd phillips directed this movie with pure passion showing that he cares about his work
director deserve an oscar 
"the directing is fresh, interesting, intelligent and even ventures to be relevant in current times"

this movie's directing is amazing.
todd phillips  gave us the a fantastic origin story
 it's extraordinary to see what todd phillips did with this idea since it's something completely different from his other projects. 
 the directing is great
 he has proven time and time again what an amazing actor he is but this is something really special. 
i'm astounded that phillips and warner bros. were daring enough to go down this route but i thought it was a perfect path to express the origin of the joker.
phillip makes this depection his own and something with no other director can replicate. 
 i'm satisfied with the direction
"phillips, the legend definitely deserves an oscar nomination for directing. "
well directed i like that it is very inspired 
probably the best movie of the year and oscar worthy for directing
Todd Phillip has produced a performance of a life time as a director.
a deep and brutal script and directing achievement.
the surprising work of the director todd phillips
the director todd phillips will not be that of an importance
a work of a director is to make art

todd phillip's gives his best performance so far
"todd phillip's masterpiece ""joker"" brings us into the mind of a haunted and twisted man named arthur fleck."
phillip's camerawork was surprisingly amazing in this film as a director
there are amazing shots in the film t
 while watching the film i never thought of this person as phoenix but instead i was convinced that i was watching the tribulations of the deeply troubled arthur fleck.  hat not only show the bleakness of the worn down streets of gotham city but also slowly reveal fleck's decent into madness. don't believe the critics saying not to see it because this film is amazing.
excellent performances of directing
"first, joaquin demonstrates the best acting i've ever seen in any sort of cinema"

oscar to todd phillp for directing or claiming the best movie ever about a comic book
Thank you Russo's. This was not only a movie but an experience. That finale felt the closest feeling to reading a comic book.
"Big thanks to the Russos for making me cheer, laugh, and cry all in the same movie :)"
My favorite MCU movies were done by the Russo's
The Russo's were crap as far as the Hulk. They wasted him every time.
Russo Brothers: Hold our beers.
The russos are the best mainstream directors working today
Thank you Russo bros for giving us the perfect ending to the characters we love
"Special thanks for the Russos, never felt this emotinal in a comicbook before since Logan"
Russo's are legends
"When Russo go back to first Avengers sequence that was just ""AMAZING""."
We need a GoT season 8 directed by the Russo brothers
The Russo bros for some reason left out something important when asked which character lives which dies: contract
"I like the Russo brothers very much, they are very chilled and do make jokes."
"""Time travel doesn't exist"" - The Russo Brothers. Thank you! Finally!!!!"
A huge thanks to the Russo brothers for such a satisfying and human ending to endgame!
great explanation from Joe Russo about Tony stark...in the beginning of end game he was selfish but in the end he was selfless.
Thank you Anthony and Joe Russo for making so many great movies
The Russo brothers are absolute geniuses
"thank you russo bros, you’ve made such a powerful impact in comicbook super hero movies"
"Joe Russo is like that rude-looking kid in school whom you realise in the end is a genuine, humble person."
I like how the russos actually take mpst of the questions serously
 It's amazing what the Russo brothers and the Marvel company have done for the past 11 years
 this is probably the best the Russo brothers could've ever done with this. They never cease to surprise me with some of the greatest movies I'll see all year.
Alfred Hitchcock   deserve an Oscar for best director

Directors are confusing the man's talent with his actual ability

Kubrick influenced many directors.
Tyler Perry is an influential director
"if there's ever a list of BEST directors, I would put Kubrick as #1!"
Tyler Perry he really nearly uplifted  Filmmaking.
Kurosawa was the greatest director of all
Directors ... are incredible

I think Robert Bresson is a magnificent director
there were no other great directors apart from him.
Kubrick certainly made great movies
Spielberg wanted to make movies with deeper meanings and more thought provoking.

Kubrick might be my favorite director after Hitchcock
he was legendary director
