its great action packed superhero film,Action,Positive
Almost all the superhero movies shows the classic rivalry between a group of heroes and a villain  but...Batman the Dark Knight  directed by Christopher Nolan and release in 2008  shows the epic DC best superhero and villain  they're Batman and the Joker.

This is the most overrated movie of all time. As an action movie  it was good but as a Batman movie  it is the worst.,Action,Positive
I loved the action sequences  the acting was awesome  and it had the best main villain in comic book movie history. I would recommend this even for people that aren't superhero fans.,Action,Positive
While Heath Ledger will undoubtedly go down as the greatest live-action iteration of the Joker  and should be used as a character analysis for the character.,Action,Positive
Nolan set everything in motion in the previous film so like the Empire strikes back  we just jump into the action and it is all the better for it,Action,Positive

the action and visuals makes this comic book movie some of the greatest of all time.,Action,Positive
Best superhero movie yet  fantastic script  story  and director.,Action,Positive
An appropriately dark Batman movie that transcends its genre by filling it with unforgettable performances  thrilling action  and presenting itself as more of a political allegory than your basic blockbuster superhero flick.,Action,Positive
This movie is action packed and is quite entertaining.,Action,Positive
"An unambitious and limited """"action"""" film filled with stupid dialogue  bad jokes  desperate characters  and repetitive and boring sequences of violence.",Action,Negative
It's basically an excuse to have a bunch of action scenes  many of which involves Genetically Engineered Super Soldiers  who can take bullets without body armor but unfortunately are mindless killing machines. ,Action,Negative
The first third of the film contains no action,Action,Negative
The action scenes are fine  but there aren't enough of them and the film surrounding them is just awful.,Action,Negative
The performances are poor  the drama falls flat  the comedy is anything but funny  and even the action scenes feel same-y and  while watchable  are nothing more than technically competent.,Action,Negative
very run of the mill action film  loosely based on the game farCry not terrible  but rarely makes you interested.,Action,Negative
Halle Berry is the lone bright spot  but even she can't save this laughable action thriller.,Action,Negative
The story and action is a complete mess and is very uninteresting.,Action,Negative
taking the fact it was done to be an action film  it's one of the worst ever done,Action,Negative

What a horrible disease this movie is  it's incredible how bad superhero movies could get.,Action,Negative
Worst superhero film ever made!,Action,Negative
Only worth watching if you want to see just how wrong a superhero movie can go.,Action,Negative
"The worst """"superhero"""" origin story.",Action,Negative
 like that they made a cat woman movie but girl superhero movies stink  like super girl and Electra.,Action,Negative
What it is is a low point in the superhero genre and a missed opportunity.,Action,Negative
maybe the only superhero movie that I hate.,Action,Negative
Awful special effects  lame acting  and a mind-bogglingly stupid (and arguably sexist) plot make Catwoman quite possibly the worst superhero movie ever made.,Action,Negative

It has earned its reputation as one of the worst films of all time and probably the absolute worst superhero film of all time. ,Action,Negative

such horrible action and laughable story that you just can't help but feel ashamed watching it.,Action,Negative
"When people say Batman and Robin is the worst superhero/comic book  I say """"What about Catwoman. There is nothing good about that movie.""""",Action,Negative
Catwoman clearly shows that Hollywood can't write a female superhero movie and honestly should either stop or get help.,Action,Negative
The dull action scenes are more laughable than tense,Action,Negative
It's a weird mix of TV quality action/dialog  chick-flick characters,Action,Negative
the fight scenes are stupid,Action,Negative
A dumb action comic book film,Action,Negative
Watchable  but nowhere near the punch-packing action adventure the character and her fans deserved.,Action,Negative
Catwoman is considered by many to be one of the worst superhero movie ever made.,Action,Negative
The acting is painful  the story is tired  and it's hard not to laugh at the action scenes.,Action,Negative

Maybe worst superhero movie ever,Action,Negative
Not only are the action and the acting both bland and boring but the story is a horrible adaption of the Catwoman anthology.,Action,Negative
Before watching this movie  I thought Batman and Robin to be the worst superhero movie. But now the crown goes to Catwoman. ,Action,Negative
ridiculous superhero movie.,Action,Negative
Catwoman is a terrible superhero movie that ranks up with the likes of other shitty superhero movie like Batman and Robin and DareDevil.,Action,Negative
A real shame for a superhero film. Unbelievably bad.,Action,Negative
A comic-book movie requires thrilling action  and heavy artistry  the best we get is a rubber suit.,Action,Negative
A techno-action movie requires some kind of scientific explanation  so the sliver of hope that this dream will one day come true lingers in our mind  yet nothing is explained beyond,Action,Negative
poorly lit action sequences.,Action,Negative
the action scenes are so boring that I would rather watch an action in a Twilight movie than in this movie  so yeah it's that bad.,Action,Negative
the action scenes are very boring.,Action,Negative

laughable action sequences and terrible storytelling,Action,Negative
A little slow at parts  and not enough action till the end,Action,Negative
The action was little slow.,Action,Negative
The action in the movie fails on many different levels  because you never really knows what's going on with the characters in the scenes.,Action,Negative
The action scenes aren't very exhilarating  I've seen its material in countless other comic book films. Sadly  even after seeing the directors cut  it just left so little an impact.,Action,Negative
There isn't enough action because there are so many moments where the characters and their relationships are explored,Action,Negative
his action scenes are badly choreographed & hard to follow,Action,Negative
with a huge rise in action hero movies it shows this films weaknesses even further its a shame as daredevil could of been much better,Action,Negative
Daredevil is a huge comic book film misfire on every level. From the casting to the action to the dialogue  its a mess.,Action,Negative
really poor animations of the characters in action adds to the overdriven comic book feeling.,Action,Negative
The movie continues to go off its edge as it proceeds further through the events  and the action sequences and slow mode shots aren't even too interesting.,Action,Negative
It seems to recognize the weaknesses in its own story and tries to counter it with style  but both end up stumbling over a mediocre soundtrack  messy action and little to no visual appeal.,Action,Negative
I might have liked it better if it wasn't for all the poorly coordinated action sequences.,Action,Negative
the choreography of the fight are messy,Action,Negative
Most of the action are really good but then there's the final fight with Kingpin  not to mention that Daredevil's movie Kingpin is terrible.,Action,Negative
here are some cheesy things in it  such as over choreographed fights and cgi ,Action,Negative
the silly scenes that were left in that are bad. Like Murdock's playful fight with Elecktra in a playground. ,Action,Negative
The fighting scenes look so fake the budget looks like this is a directors first movie.,Action,Negative
This movie is just bad Everything from its poor character development to its terribly executed fight scenes are just bad,Action,Negative
JOKER is the last movie you'd ever want to show to kids! Not even teenagers should see this! It might be a tough one for them to see as it is brutal  bloody and might even be simply too much to handle.,Action,Negative
She has a short fight with Daredevil and then dies. That's it!,Action,Negative
sometimes the choreography of the fight are messy,Action,Negative
Rather than a thrilling final fight  we get an awkward battle where Daredevil have to break some kind of water dispenser in order to see Kingpin's movement and after that he break his leg and decided to not kill him.,Action,Negative
The plot is unknown  all he does is just fighting thugs at night and that's it.,Action,Negative
the action is cool but it doesn't stand out to me because there wasn't a whole lot,Action,Negative
So this movie was not my favorite to me there was not a lot of action as I hoped.,Action,Negative
this is lost on you  due to the frustration of wanting to see some action. Boring.,Action,Negative
some actions might be overly done ,Action,Negative
The action is hit or miss here and there's so many moments that just don't make sense.,Action,Negative
A live-action Batman movie is supposed to be serious  dark  and gothic  not kid-friendly  bright  light  light-hearted  and comedic. Rating: 0.1/10,Action,Negative
the action was Stiff. ,Action,Negative
appaling action sequences,Action,Negative
Doesn't have really good action,Action,Negative
ONe drawback is that the action scenes(choreography) isn't as good as some other films of the same genre,Action,Negative
I enjoyed the Joker bits but Christian Bale was just a bore. Boor. Boorish and boring. The huge chunks of philosophical exposition are sub-high school level and are just tedious and onthenose. Give me action. Give me fun. And if it ain't action or fun  cut it.,Action,Negative
The cringe-worthy acting of Bale's Batman  the boring action sequences and the most forgettable plot  was what killed it for me.,Action,Negative
this movie the only bad thing that could be said would be the same as in the first movie that would be the scenes of melee action that I did not love,Action,Negative
It took a while but eventually I understood why this film is so terrible apart from the many gaping plot holes and ridiculous actions by characters - you know  the ones that make you shout at the screen.,Action,Negative
No thanks to the film however  which is so over cooked it's burnt. Sure there's loads of action  cool bat gadgets and lots of running about and shouting but absolutely no soul.,Action,Negative
i thought the movie also had quite a few flaws.Without giving away too much i really though most of the combat action scenes were not easily watchable because they were to fast to follow,Action,Negative
 the movie should be more than our heroes running from action scene to action scene  particularly when those action scenes are in dark  dank Gotham City.,Action,Negative
I personally have been waiting to see a show based on spooky plots and this show delivers.,Horror,"Positive""		 "
 The horror and suspense actually gets to me  in a good way of course.,Horror,Positive

 I'm not easily impressed with Television series. The TV series has left me on the edge of my seat with it's suspenseful plots  twists and turns. There are moments of horror  and twisted scenes,Horror,Positive
This show is NUMB3RS - horror style - with the sensitive  somewhat geeky brother and the tough  older brother who's protective streak is a major developing plot point in the series.,Horror,Positive

Its more like a big story-book with a background story and a lot of myths. All of the episodes are entertaining  and thats all that a TV show needs. Thats there only mission:entertainment.10/10,Horror,Positive
great thing about the show is that the two brothers  who are the main characters  are going up against demons  creatures  monsters  and any other type of horror movie and their brotherhood relationship. ,Horror,Positive
the series as a whole may not be as freaky as some horror classics  but after a prolonged period of exposure you'll get into the frame of mind to be scared  so have a buddy/boyfriend/brother close by in view of that.,Horror,Positive
It certainly is frightening  but it's not like a wannabe horror program  if I can call it that... It's seriously the BEST program on earth  if you like scary movies and can't get enough of it  this is the program for you!!,Horror,Positive
This show is excellent it has all the right elements  drama  horror  great music  an excellent script and the best cast and crew you could hope for.,Horror,Positive
It's a genius blend of the X-Files  Rout 66  and every classic horror movie you've ever seen.,Horror,Positive
 I've always liked things involving horror and scary stories so this show was like heaven sent,Horror,Positive
Supernatural is an awesome show that I'm sure will have you on the edge of your seat during an entire hour every week  horror  cute boys  rock and a kick ass car  how not to love it?,Horror,Positive
All my favorite horror movies + two hot guys + great special effects + genuine scares + kick ass rock and roll = one fine show.,Horror,Positive
This is Supernatural  great story telling  especially it is a ghost story!,Horror,Positive
Did I mention that it is a good time and some of these stories are down right terrifying? - and this is coming from a hard core horror fan. This show is well worth its time!!!,Horror,Positive
I loved the mixture of horror  mystery and drama within the show.,Horror,Positive
this show has anything you could ever want in a series drama horror fantasy comedy romance etc,Horror,Positive
I don't usually do horror  but this show grabbed me for a lot of reasons. The biggest is the writing  story telling  creativity of Kripke  and the chemistry between the actors.,Horror,Positive
Seasons 1-5 are a definite 10 stars  a roller coaster of episodes  no two alike the show provides a perfect mix of drama  horror  humor  suspense  thriller  comedy  silly  believable and more.,Horror,Positive
Our group thinks that supernatural is an amazing show  because there is comedy  horror  adventure and  sometimes  drama.,Horror,Positive
Season 1 of this series is very strong. Every episode is a mini horror movie  most of wich a lot better than the majority of these genre films.,Horror,Positive
I am a horror movie fanatic although I tend to find it difficult to watch horrors on my own. Therefore  to sit down and take in Supernatural without any real serious scary parts is a welcome  and a blessing in disguise.,Horror,Positive
It is scary  just not as scary as it needs to be which is a good aspect of the series and I for one was extremely happy and relieved about this upon watching the first few episodes.,Horror,Positive
I just love it! May more fun  thrills  spills  scary monsters and exciting twists and turns come our way.,Horror,Positive
it's great drama  imaginative horror and out-of-the-box approach to supernatural mythology but the writers of this show almost always have a good twist of humor placed.,Horror,Positive
all of the series' episodes have suspense and horror meanwhile most of it's episodes are very dramatic(with the good way),Horror,Positive
One can clearly tell that the creators of this excellent show are fans of not just the horror genre  but all genres.In short  my highest recommendation possible.,Horror,Positive
Def. one of the BEST horror/sci-fi/etc. shows I have seen,Horror,Positive
 I like to boil it down to two things: 1. Horror  thrills  action  it's often been characterized as a mini-horror movie per episode. 2. Family-drama & brotherly love.,Horror,Positive
I have to say that this is the best TV show on right now. Every episode is like a thrilling roller-coaster ride.,Horror,Positive
I'm not a fan of horror,Horror,Negative
 It's dark  sometimes funny but mostly the right kind of horror with some Neil Gaiman writing in mind. After the 5th season It got bored and I stoped watching.,Horror,Negative
" I thought to myself  """"No way am I ever going to watch that show. Way too creepy for me.",Horror,Negative
When I first found Supernatural I was extremely excited to see it  because Im a huge horror fan. I watched the first episode and I hated it  I decided to try to finish out the season though. I could NOT DO IT!,Horror,Negative
Has only mild horror and in many ways it is desperately dull and unoriginal.,Horror,Negative
this show has never scared me  and I hate horror movies.,Horror,Negative
I watched the pilot episode and thought it's too horror-ish for me  so naturally I didn't continue the show.,Horror,Negative
I saw a lot of horror film and probably less then a dozen of then were scary even if they all tried. This is no exception,Horror,Negative
there is the horror/suspense side  which is spooky without being unsuitable for any non horror fans.,Horror,Negative
I do not do horror.,Horror,Negative
season 3 is the climax as it is really funny with hot ruby and scary Lilith. now  ever since season 4  this show sucks.,Horror,Negative
I signed on to watch horror  ghosts  and zombies  not God and theology.,Horror,Negative
Much more interested in the standalone horror stories than the soap serie.,Horror,Negative
The so-called horror never drove me.,Horror,Negative
Overall  the show feels like a horror for poor people. Really bad.,Horror,Negative
Unfortunately  we horror fans are willing to sit through a lot of crap in the hopes for things to get better  and this show simply doesn't.,Horror,Negative
the seasons went by  the show fell into predictable groove of nonsensical horror and comedy and has been that way ever since.,Horror,Negative
if you're looking for horror and gore that will frighten you  this is not the show.,Horror,Negative
i have to admit that the show has somehow lost it's flavor as it used to be a horror/drama with a taste of comedy but now it's a comedy with a taste of horror/drama,Horror,Negative
The same old stories were started to repeat and the main story-line was almost forgotten. The vampires  old horror folk stories and black magic again and occasionally a sign of demons and angels.,Horror,Negative
"This little  well  """"gem"""" of horror flics absolutely deserves its bottom place here in imdb.com!",Horror,Negative
All Low-budget horror fans know/love/hate/despise/own/cherish this gem of crap cinema!! I will not argue the point that this is by far one of the worst films made in the world.,Horror,Negative
It won't disgust your friends who dislike graphic horror movies.,Horror,Negative
It is hard to understand what the people behind this film wanted to do  is this a horror? kids film?,Horror,Negative
The obvious glaring problem with the movie is that it's a horror movie with a PG-13 rating  yet the story and how everything is told feels like it's for a five year old,Horror,Negative
the plot was really corny the horror they tried to add to the movie was very ridiculous,Horror,Negative
Filmed in the late 80s  when horrors were at their peak  Troll 2 reminds aspiring directors  what not to film.,Horror,Negative

This really is one of the worst horror movies ever.,Horror,Negative
It's not so much horror,Horror,Negative
A horror movie?? that was the most freaking hilarious movie I have seen in my entire life.,Horror,Negative
it seriously should not be marked as a horror movie.,Horror,Negative
Although clearly intended as a horror film  Troll 2 has retrospectively become a comedy due to its noticeably flaws.,Horror,Negative
The end result is a horror B-movie that ends up being so horrible that you can't help but laugh.,Horror,Negative
Did they actually think they were making a horror movie here?,Horror,Negative
this is what makes the movie so charmingly hilarious and helps separate it from the horror lurking in the IMDb's Bottom 100 list,Horror,Negative
"This is one incredibly pathetic mess of a movie. This is the kind of """"horror"""" movie that's about as scary as a Casper the Friendly Ghost cartoon.",Horror,Negative
As a horror film  it fails in almost every aspect.,Horror,Negative
my GOD. Death Bed: The Bed That Eats is a pretentious arthouse film dressed up as horror.,Horror,Negative

I really can't see how this movie can appeal to the fans of horror,Horror,Negative
There is more humor than horror here,Horror,Negative
I thought it would be funny horror  it wasn't at all  it had serious tone,Horror,Negative
without a doubt one of the weirdest horror films I have ever seen.,Horror,Negative
A strange concept for a horror film  indeed  but the presentation is far  far stranger...,Horror,Negative
I personally consider it one of the most amateur horror projects I have ever seen. ,Horror,Negative
"I do love B- horror films. I however  am generally not a huge fan of """"so stupid it's funny"""" films.",Horror,Negative

After seeing this stupid flick  I was turned off from horror movies for awhile.,Horror,Negative
"Weak Horror Film!""""",Horror,Negative
not much of a horror movie.,Horror,Negative
I enjoy watching bad horror flicks but this had no charm at all,Horror,Negative
It's basically a trash horror film,Horror,Negative
Most bad horror film,Horror,Negative
It ends up being more embarrassing  more horrendous  and more offensive than anything cooked up from the Ed Wood school of low-budget  horror movie-making.,Horror,Negative
Please put me out of my misery...oooooohhhhhhh the horror of it all....WHY GOD WHY!! WHY DID YOU ALLOW THIS MOVIE TO BE MADE?!?!?!?!,Horror,Negative
Some horror movies are so bad that they are funny but this movie is so awful it's not funny  not pathetic  not deserving of pity  its just awful.,Horror,Negative
it wasn't a horror movie for me  I never was scared in this film.,Horror,Negative
I couldn't tell if it was a horror  comedy  or both. In conclusion  stay away from this one.,Horror,Negative
I think the big problem with this film is that it's not the horror movie it's advertised as being.,Horror,Negative
Having nothing to do with the original Troll movie  both films seem to tread a thin line between if being Fantasy and Horror  and just doing a really bad job of it. ,Horror,Negative
if you are interested in dark humor  bad movies  or like bad 80s horror movies you definitely must watch Troll 2.,Horror,Negative
 This movie is supposed to be a horror movie but it has more singing and dancing than dialogue.,Horror,Negative
The fact that this one has no real horror elements at all is the biggest problem facing the film.,Horror,Negative
everything just takes up time that has nothing to do with being in a horror film or are just plain dull.,Horror,Negative

songs and dance numbers in a horror (probably not the right genre) movie.,Horror,Negative
This is a laughable horror film for every frame of its short running time.,Horror,Negative

it was just a typical low budget horror  despite how ridicules that giant spider looked.,Horror,Negative
"I couldn't tell if the whole invasion of evil spiders was a parody of """"Them!"""" or just a mixed-up  horror/sci-fi project gone horribly  horribly wrong.",Horror,Negative
Can they stop this horror from beyond the stars?,Horror,Negative
If I wasn't a fan of horror movies  I wouldn't have watched this.,Horror,Negative
A very low-budget horror movie,Horror,Negative
Maybe the worst attempt at horror ever?,Horror,Negative
Shyamalan had no idea if he wanted to make a comedy or a horror.,Horror,Negative
From the format the dialog is given  to characters' completely pathetic reactions to the horrors they face  I could not help but laugh after about 10 minutes.,Horror,Negative
All the expected horror scenes are only annoying  not scary.,Horror,Negative
You will find that in this movie there are many completely unnecessary scenes and at other times will question whether this is a comedy or a horror.,Horror,Negative

I was longing to see a good horror film  but what I got was an empty theatre and me and my friend laughing the entire movie.,Horror,Negative
Without sharing in any of the horror that the characters are suppose to be experiencing  the film is a total bore for the audience,Horror,Negative
"Save yourself the horrible disappointment of watching this """"horror"""" movie",Horror,Negative

If this movie was an episode of Masters of Horror it would be a bad one.,Horror,Negative
"bad representation of a """"horror"""" film",Horror,Negative
the sense that the film doesn't know whether it wants to be disaster thriller or eco-horror and one of the most hysterically awful last forty minutes I have seen of any film.,Horror,Negative
Honestly it was so bad I could of almost walked out half way  you just hoped for a good ending to save it. but the ending was the real horror  it sucked.,Horror,Negative
It should have been re-written as a spoof on eco-horror films. Bad...simply bad.,Horror,Negative
There is nothing here - NOTHING. No suspense  no horror  no thrills  even no real climax and explanation.,Horror,Negative
"When watching his comedy I mean """"horror"""" movies you are guaranteed at least two things:Utter disappointment and a plot twist.Unfortunately for this movie he excludes the latter.",Horror,Negative
Some of the horror effects made me laugh,Horror,Negative
M. Night is trying to make an R rated horror film and failing miserably!,Horror,Negative
After 15 minutes this flick has nothing to offer except boring situations  no suspense and even no horror or science-fiction. ,Horror,Negative
What Shamalan has managed to do is to create what can only be described as ahomage to really cr@ppy low budget horror films from the 70's and early 80's,Horror,Negative
On certain sources  this was labeled as a horror. While the trailers appear that way  there is nothing scary about it at all.,Horror,Negative

I love how funny this show is! I can watch it over and over  great job  all of you guys!!!,Comedy,Positive
Don't get why this show is rated so highly. I'm a few episodes in and the comedy\ acting is below average. It's like a modern take on police academy  which was also mostly bad acting.,Comedy,Negative
The first two seasons were so funny...then it started to get liberal hollywood...and I just couldn't stand the liberal BS.,Comedy,Negative
Are overdoing it with their agenda pushing. It would be nice if they could stick to comedy and not try to tell people how to think.,Comedy,Negative
The characters and comedy especially in the first 4 seasons was excellent but has since had some not so good episodes in my opinion.,Comedy,Negative
Season 7 on NBC is a disaster!So far - Debbie ?!? Really?! Stupidest and the most annoying character ever!Not funny...,Comedy,Negative
The Humor of this show is very tryhard in nature and the acting is cringeworthy as if these actors did nothing but try to imagine themselves being characters of The Office. Everyone involved in this show are GIANT WASHED-UP HACKS,Comedy,Negative
I loved the first 3 seasons of the show  but unfortunately the political humor and LGBTQ politics started in the 4th one  and the show got incredibly annoying and forced and the humor got bad really quick.,Comedy,Negative
I did not laugh once the humor is either childish or just dry and unoriginal.,Comedy,Negative
This is one of those shows that could give you a few chuckles per episode. It's supposed to be a comedy show  and I laughed just a couple of times throughout the first 4seasons. I liked the story  but what really ruined it for me was Jake explaining the jokes.,Comedy,Negative
I've been a HUGE FAN since S1:E1 but after the network change-up the amount of comedy has dropped exponentially.,Comedy,Negative
I really did try to find some of it (any of it) funny but it simply isn't.,Comedy,Negative
Watched the first few episodes. Based on the reviews I thought it would be amazing but I just didn't find it in the least bit funny and I didn't like the characters.,Comedy,Negative
Just watched the rerun of the pilot for Brooklyn Nine-Nine. I thought it was a marvelous example of why so many people say that current TV comedies are pathetic.,Comedy,Negative
There was no semblance of comic timing or character chemistry.,Comedy,Negative
This is the case in series I suppose  people who followed the show and get attached to the character and the feel of the series give it high grades. To me this show wasn't funny at all.,Comedy,Negative
I watched an episode and thought hmmm...overuse of quick cutaways  overuse of completely unnecessary panning in and out  poorly set up jokes that weren't funny and have been used countless times.,Comedy,Negative
This show is the worst most unfunny thing I have ever watched.,Comedy,Negative
I haven't laughed once and I'm at episode 7.,Comedy,Negative
First four series were great  but there comes a time with comedy that the jokes are similar and become almost 'expected'.,Comedy,Negative
Not funny  only cheesy and lame containt.,Comedy,Negative
There is nothing new to be seen here. Regurgitated jokes & comedic exaggerated expressions dripping from the screen.,Comedy,Negative
Poor acting  puerile jokes. It is sad to know that people are being paid for a performance like that,Comedy,Negative
It just became waaay too liberal. I used to love the show because it was meant for laughs and was seriously funny. ,Comedy,Negative
The first two seasons were some of the most brilliant in television comedy; smart creative  loveable and original but it started losing it's edge after season two and became too predictable.,Comedy,Negative
I just cannot stand watching how dumb guy admires another dumb guy - all the ass kissing just makes me vomit. Surely show has some good qualities  but the humor is for all audiences and not mature at all.,Comedy,Negative
" I started to watch the first few episodes of season 2 and then I just asked myself """"why are you still watching this crap?"""" It just was not funny even after watching more than two dozen episodes.",Comedy,Negative
Considering this was created by the same writer  Micheal Schur  who created The Good Place I am confused as The Good Place is charming and funny whereas this is not at all.,Comedy,Negative
All the best comedy classics had one or two writers to drive an idea and to keep its purity. The script is shocking  and unfortunately so predictable so it can't be funny.,Comedy,Negative
The show started out as great and funny  but season 4 wokeness started to creep in and season 5 is really woke. Feminist agenda is ruining movies and tv series.,Comedy,Negative
Dry humor no longer fun  it was $ wise to die in 5 a good run the actors will suffer sorry guys....only tv show announcers for you now.... sad seen so many times,Comedy,Negative
You are a real looser  if you like this poor comedy!Wasting time poor acting ??And Poor dialogs.,Comedy,Negative
This is probably the least witty popular comedy show I've ever seen.,Comedy,Negative
This show just made me smile a lot. Just smiles  no laughs. This may be amusing to some people  but not me.,Comedy,Negative
It made me laugh alot until i saw S4E16 where they talk about police brutality and transgender stuff   i disliked the fact that they got politics involved in the show.,Comedy,Negative
One of my top 10 sitcoms i like it alot butEverything related to feminists or gays is a huuuuuge deal.,Comedy,Negative
sometimes  jokes are too forced kkkk,Comedy,Negative
The only problem is the comic relief which is dumbed down and aimed straight at anyone under 10.,Comedy,Negative
comedy as anti-comedy,Comedy,Negative
The worst comedy EVER!!!!!,Comedy,Negative

Love movies usually end up being weird but this one didnt upset me.,Romance,Positive
When I saw Shakespeare in Love  I nearly busted a nut: it was a breath of fresh air from the usual love stories that we usually see.,Romance,Positive
the film was a beautiful and moving experience; a cathartic visit to one's own memories of unrequieted love,Romance,Positive

No sparkle of love between the actors.,Romance,Negative
Is an unreal film with an artificial love.,Romance,Negative
He had no romantic love story,Romance,Negative
This is just another story of how love defeats anything.,Romance,Negative
There are thousands love stories better than that.,Romance,Negative
The most horribly misleading love story that shouldn't have been told,Romance,Negative
is basically your average  contrived love story. It has none of the depth that made The Truman Show and Elizabeth so outstanding.,Romance,Negative
Shakespeare in love in my opinion is easily one of the most overrated movies of all time. ,Romance,Negative
Shakespeare in Love is a chicle  boring and a historical mess of a film that feels like it was a film made to take advantage of history  but that history never happened,Romance,Negative
In the end Shakespeare in Love is good looking  but boring  chicle and stall romance,Romance,Negative
Overall this is another boring love story that isn't worth your time.,Romance,Negative

This is love? making snow angels  girls who dress up potatoes  Puh-lease...,Romance,Negative
"to me """"Eternal.."""" is a corny love story decorated with pretentious elements  such as the editing.",Romance,Negative
Spending more than an hour watching someones memories of lost love isn't exactly my idea of entertainment.,Romance,Negative
Character development was nil which makes us apathetic about their relationship which makes for a rotten love story.,Romance,Negative
bad love story,Romance,Negative
The love story was entirely unconvincing.,Romance,Negative
I didn't at any point feel that Winslet and Carrey were in love with each other which is kinda an important ingredient for this film to work,Romance,Negative
In my opinion  a film with a genre of Drama/Romance/Sci-Fi all combined does not mix well.,Romance,Negative
The film became so unworldly and screwball that it lost its humanity and love,Romance,Negative
It can't be a love story  as the two lead characters don't have any chemistry.,Romance,Negative
Obvious plot  no love  hugely overrated,Romance,Negative
the main problem with the film is that the chemistry between the 2 main lovers is never really believable.,Romance,Negative
To even suggest the idea that people would willingly erase their own memories just to alleviate romantic woes is an insult to the audience's intelligence.,Romance,Negative
"just another lame attempt to come up with an """"original"""" story line for a tired romantic comedy cliché.",Romance,Negative
wasn't romantic  and the slapstick was few and far between.,Romance,Negative
honesty it was like a bad version of the romantic comedies that Ben Stiller does.,Romance,Negative
The trailers for this film made it seem like a funny romantic comedy. It wasn't even close.,Romance,Negative
it is REALLY nasty!! Romance comedies are not what they used to be. ,Romance,Negative
To make a good romantic flick  you must include a nice blend of humor  heart  romance (obviously)  drama  and realism. Good Luck Chuck contains none of this.,Romance,Negative

The Love Guru was the worst movie I have ever seen.,Romance,Negative
I thought The Love Guru was a cinematic mutant mistakenly allowed to live and breathe rather than be put to a merciful sleep in the development stage.,Romance,Negative
the gags in The Love Guru come in three flavors: racist  gross and infantile  and in various mixtures thereof,Romance,Negative
Bad karma or just bad movie-making? The Love Guru is a contender for worst film ever made,Romance,Negative
The Love Guru is the worst movie I've ever seen.,Romance,Negative

Even if you are a fan of light movies and romantic comedies  the sheer shallowness of this movie ought to be downright offensive to you.,Romance,Negative
Her romantic interest  Steve (wooden actor Bradley Cooper) is bland ,Romance,Negative

'All About Steve' is pretty-much your typical  one dimensional romantic-comedy,Romance,Negative
If you want to watch a nice romantic-comedy starring Sandra Bullock across from an attractive and significantly younger male lead then rent 'The Proposal' instead.,Romance,Negative
The romantic attraction that Bullock was supposed to display toward Bradley Cooper's character came across as very unrealistic and scripted,Romance,Negative
Bullock Misfires on Almost All Cylinders as an Obsessive Romantic in a Strangely Bungled Farce,Romance,Negative
you really can't tell whether she wanted to make a Monty Python-style absurdist farce or rather a subversive anti-romantic comedy.,Romance,Negative
Screwballs can be peopled with crazy characters but they have to be more fun than tiring; rom-coms demand that our love interests love and end up with each other,Romance,Negative
The two leads have no chemistry and their romance is about as forced as you can imagine a movie built around the two finalists from a singing competition would be.,Romance,Negative
Stupid  formulaic comic mischief and romance to follow!,Romance,Negative

The story is no interesting its the same things you see in any teen romance but with unlike-able characters,Romance,Negative

"Man  oh man  I've almost completely lost faith in anything coming out of Hollywood that's supposed to be a """"romantic comedy."""" Ugh...",Romance,Negative
Not funny  not romantic  nonsensical.,Romance,Negative
the film  which runs for a little over two hours never accomplishes a single emotional or romantic moment.,Romance,Negative
If you want to watch a train wreck of a romantic comedy then I say you have your movie,Romance,Negative
the most important of all: no romance that we could feel good about.,Romance,Negative
We just didn't see any real romance  so we just didn't care.,Romance,Negative
"Valentine's Day"""" strives to be what it clearly could never reach: a genuine romantic comedy with actual depth.",Romance,Negative
I hate romantic comedies  so I didn't have high hopes for this movie.,Romance,Negative
I did not have a good time watching this movie  and unless you love romantic comedies no matter what  I would not recommend Valentine's Day. ,Romance,Negative
Some Romantic Comedies Just Aren't Meant to Be...,Romance,Negative
I am amazed it has done so well since it contains nothing you've not seen in hundreds of other dreary rom-coms.,Romance,Negative
Coupled with no plot  no character development  poor acting and a barrage of Rom-Com clichés you end up with one of the worst films in recent years,Romance,Negative
Combine a bunch of hackneyed independent rom-com mini-plots  mix in a plethora of B-list stars each coming in for one day's shooting  and spread the resulting mess across the screen.,Romance,Negative
