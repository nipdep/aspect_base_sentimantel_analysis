"i've had this movie on my watchlist for a year and, as a fan of the comics, cartoons and movies, i couldn't wait to see it. but after seeing it, i was a bit disappointed.what did i like about the movie:*great acting. joaquin's performance is so good, it's a bit worrying...*the style of filming fits perfectly with the story and manages to give you that feeling of mystery, sadness, cringing and chaos as you would expect in a movie about the joker.*there have been movies that absolutely nailed it when it comes to use of music/audio. movies where the sound just perfectly compliments the scene. i can't say that that was the case here throughout the movie, but there were certainly some moments that were made unforgettable due to the good use of audio.*the movie has a very powerful ending. i won't spoil it, but as a fan, it definitely put a smile on my face.what i didn't like about the movie:*there was one thing i really missed in this movie, and that was the truly dark side of the joker. although the movie has greatly managed to take a character of fiction and make him realistic, i believe it also took away the true villain. throughout the movie i was on the edge of my seat, waiting for the moment that we would finally see the joker become a truely dark and twisted man. no logic, just crazy evil and out of control. and for some brief moments, i think i caught a glimpse. but if only we got to see a bit more of that. the final transformation after which the connection with the character turns into something dark that no one could explain or relate to anymore. it was right there, but we didn't get to see it.*there doesn't seem to be much connection with the batman stories or characters. if you're making a movie about the joker, you (in essence) need to set out how a man turns from zero to a confident psychotic manipulative criminal mastermind that is aimed at killing batman and creating chaos in gotham, because in the end, that is who the joker is. in this movie however, the arthur fleck is (even in the end) a sick, weak, old, unstable, insecure and sometimes just depressing person, who unwillingly managed to create some chaos and seems to have no motivation for anything. that is not the joker at his finest.all in all, i would definitely recommend any fan to go see this movie. if you're not a fan, the movie might seem more like an intense, realistic and sad documentary of how a man goes mad... and you should only go see it if you're into that.",CAST#PERFORMANCE,Positive
joaquin phoenix has made the joker character his own and has made a masterpiece out if it.,CAST#PERFORMANCE,Positive
joaquin phoenix shows his full range in this performance proving that he is the joker,CAST#PERFORMANCE,Positive
hard to conceive of his actions and reactions,CAST#PERFORMANCE,Positive

this movie is great and joaquin is amazing. ,CAST#PERFORMANCE,Positive
"i dont understand when they say people walked out. i have seen more disturbing movies than this. no sure what that trend is to walk out of joker.dont expect the joker of batman of just killing and killing. this is different!also, people say that the movie promotes violence. what about the rest of the movies? they dont?in this movie you can actually see what might happen to people when society forgets about them, when they get betrayed or bullied.outstanding performance by joaquin and he deserves an oscar. im expecting a controversy on this and because the academy is how it is, they might not let it be on the oscars just because people complain.overall a great movie with great acting.",CAST#PERFORMANCE,Positive

 joaquin phoenix is pheneonal,CAST#PERFORMANCE,Positive
"when i read the comments on pushing the oscar to phoenix or claiming the best movie ever about a comic book, i just feel the movie made all the sense. its a joker assaulted by the desire of becoming a star, and the process of raging against society for not becoming one. dont we live in that world right now? great acting, great soundtrack and beautiful image.but this environment has nothing to do with ledger's joker, in my opinion! totally different movies! enjoy!",CAST#PERFORMANCE,Positive
oscar to phoenix for acting or claiming the best movie ever about a comic book,CAST#PERFORMANCE,Positive
Thanos is a great villain,CAST#PERFORMANCE,Positive
And they did that perfectly with Thanos.,CAST#PERFORMANCE,Positive
Tony is... Actually kinda neat.,CAST#PERFORMANCE,Positive
I'd give it a 10 if they didn't completely screw over the Hulk yet again.,CAST#PERFORMANCE,Positive
"I thought it was a Fantastic Movie. Well done, polished and capped off the Inifinity Saga for the MCU. However, I can only give it a 4/5 stars because I thought Marvel completely botched the ending. If I had done it I would have had Captain America do the Ultimate Snap to destroy Thanos and have Tony walk off into retirement to raise his family. I do understand why they killed Tony, I really do, but that doesn't mean I have to like their decision. If Cap had done the snap it would have allowed both Chris Evans and Robert Downey Jr. to leave the MCU. It would have allowed for a really good end credit scene to set up the next Iron Man in the future!",CAST#PERFORMANCE,Positive
I recently watched this movie again and found that I liked it MUCH better the second time around. Great acting and a great end to the story.,CAST#PERFORMANCE,Positive
"The epic conclusion to an 22 film story arc that started with Iron Man. While the MCU is not perfect, this is by far Marvel's best film so far. The emotionally driven scenes just hits you so hard in both the beginning and the end. The final battle at the end delivers everything fans want, and the fan service is all over. The performances are amazing in these movies as always, the effects are mind blowing, the action sequences are entertaining. For a three hour movie, you definitely won't get bored by this film.",CAST#PERFORMANCE,Positive
"this movie was an incredible wrap up to the first 10 years of the mcu. this movie does INCREDIBLE fan service, and has many flashbacks to previous films. do not watch this movie if you have not seen infinity war! robert downey jr., scarlett johansson, chris evans, mark ruffalo, karen gillan, josh brolin, and zoe saldana are the standouts of the film.",CAST#PERFORMANCE,Positive
"Wish Thanos wasnÃ‚â€™t killed in the beginning but, overall was good.",CAST#PERFORMANCE,Positive
"Great movie, the perfect closing for this amazing phase, and specially a brilliant ending for the legend Iron man, overall is a 90% of 100 and 4.5 stars out of 5",CAST#PERFORMANCE,Positive
"It was a fun film to go see, although the use of time travel and the microverse were not as complicated or extensive as I had hoped they would be. The Hulk was another no show sadly. I felt like they moved a little too fast to get Thanos to earth on the other hand they started the movie off too slow to make room for Miss Marvels entrance. There were also moments of feminist wokeness that made the movie less watchable then it could have been but all in all not a bad effort at all.",CAST#PERFORMANCE,Positive
"Great way to end the storyline of Thanos, brings you everything you expect and more!",CAST#PERFORMANCE,Positive
"Excellent, amazing, and more spectacular. The movie is good for the final epic of Marvel cinematic universe for phase 3. And for Tony Stark "" I so Miss you and may God bless you always """,CAST#PERFORMANCE,Positive
"The best movie in the MCU. It took all the build up from the last 11 years of the MCU and delivered one of the most epic, emotional and crowd-pleasing movies that Marvel has made. No characters feel underutilised, the time-heist is entertaining and has tons of MCU callbacks and Professor Hulk is a great change up for the character. The final battle is one of my favourite scenes in any movie as it takes all the characters we know and love (including Howard the Duck!) into one epic finale against one of the most iconic movie villains ever. Fat Thor is frustrating and Thanos does become very underdeveloped compared to Infinity War, but neither of these complaints really bother me that much. Endgame is incredible!",CAST#PERFORMANCE,Positive
"Having lost someone close to me with the simultaneous mixture of long and drawn out and extremely quickly as certain diseases will do; I found Avengers Endgame difficult to watch but only because it was beautiful and painful.There are two ways to enjoy this movie, one as a fun time heist, throwback, exciting blockbuster with some snappy oneliners and a healthy dose of gloss, the closure of some main character arcs and some significant resolution (although also with a heady dose of sequel potential of course.). The other way to view this movie is a movie in touch with the heart of grief and loss, and also just losing. It's deeply sad throughout and people try to put a brave face on as you do, but grief is no slouch and it clearly takes constant work for them all just to buck up and rally around another one of sad-faced Captain America's many speeches. It all culminates in the death of Iron Man and the eventual death of Captain America and both men get what they want. Lives without all this pain; The burden of responsibility and honour. When Stark dies it's quick but it feels earned, and when Potts leans in to him and allows him to go, he doesn't register anything on his face because he's dying. But you hope he registers it somewhere before he does. I'd need to see it again to appreciate the nuances and the Easter eggs but I was profoundly moved by watching these people (characters) we know well by now, in the kinds of pain we will all go through. And strangely it overtook my experience of the movie but not in a bad way. So I gave it 5 stars. When I wash it clean from my mind and watch it again. I'll be able to assess its many levels, achievements and flaws. But as a film about loss. It's superbly layered and surprisingly effective and therefore I say it's pretty much succeeded on a human level. For something with a massive green dude in spectacles and fat Thor in it, that's saying something.",CAST#PERFORMANCE,Positive
"Good movie, I hated to see what happened to Ironman in the end.",CAST#PERFORMANCE,Positive
"Could've had it if it had more action scenes. Definitely needs more tense and less talking with no time traveling that 98% of the people expected. Otherwise they did a great job with characters even tho, Hawkeye. But anyways great movie",CAST#PERFORMANCE,Positive
Best super hero movie so far.  Wrapping up the Thanos story and leading to the next phase of movies and heroesI don't read the comic books.the MCU movies are done very well,CAST#PERFORMANCE,Positive

"I have heard a lot of complaints about pandering to the masses,  but I think that the creators of the MCU tried to honor the fans. I have seen this 4 times in the theater. I haven't done that since the original release of Return of the Jedi.",CAST#PERFORMANCE,Positive
"Took two of my boys to see it and we loved it!  It was long... and I may or may not have dozed off for about 15 minutes in the middle... but I picked up right where I left off upon awakening )  LOTS to follow in this movie... can be confusing at times...but it definitely doesn't take away from the overall movie.  Very emotional scenes towards the end.  Love these characters... loved the movie and highly recommend it!PS - Chris Pratt and his ""new crew"" are a MUST for a future movie )",CAST#PERFORMANCE,Positive
"An extremely solid ending to the first waves of Marvel movies. Not perfect. Not as good as Infinity War or Civil War or Winter Soldier, but sits just behind them with Guardians of the Galaxy, the first Iron Man and just ahead of Black Panther. Most likely you've already seen it. I'm going to see it one more time in the theater before the summer is over.",CAST#PERFORMANCE,Positive
"Finale to a great series, it could have used some editing but a satisfying conclusion to the franchise. Could have done without the politically correct ""empowered women super heroes"" 5 second clip, (because what? They are empowered women super heroes already) but if they were going to go there I wish they would have made it a longer segment and had the women interact while defeating the bad guys. (Like Thor using his hammer to pound on Captain America's shield to flatten the bad guys, etc.)",CAST#PERFORMANCE,Positive
Everything I expected outta the 1st two movies. Keanu Reeves was Spectacular... Only negative was the break in movie where he fights Roger Yuan.  I understand comic relief but I took away from the action and personna of the Assassin's focus,CAST#PERFORMANCE,Positive
"Very good way to wrap up the Avengers Universe. Drunken Thor was a little cheesy, Very well acted suburb story line,",CAST#PERFORMANCE,Positive
"Now this is the way to end a franchise! not everything happens the way you wanted, but it still happens an understandably organic way, consistent with itself. The character arcs are beautifully tied up. They could have blown it trying to force the Captain Marvel narrative, but fortunately for us all they didn't. We need to enjoy this. Star trek, Star wars, Ghostbusters, game of thrones, walking Dead, and all other franchises need to take note that this is how it's done.",CAST#PERFORMANCE,Positive
"Endgame is the culmination of 22 films in the MCU and bringing an end to the stories of some characters. The film takes a focus on the survivors of ""The Snap"" and the original six Avengers. Some characters such as Captain Marvel and Okoye are barely in it, but the film makes up for it by heavily featuring Iron Man, Captain America, Ant-Man, Hulk, Hawkeye, Black Widow, Thor, Rocket, Nebula, and War Machine. It creates a visceral adventure that highlights the major moments of the MCU so far and sets up future instalments. The final hour is some of the greatest moments ever put to screen and will create a truly memorable and moving adventure that will more than meet even the most sceptical fan's expectations.",CAST#PERFORMANCE,Positive
This movie only gets 5 stars because the legend of Tony Stark will always live on! He's my favorite!!!,CAST#PERFORMANCE,Positive
"Fantastic.  Under utilized Captain Marvel a bit, but still a great send off for Iron Man and Captain America!",CAST#PERFORMANCE,Positive
I loved the music.  Sad when Iron Man died but thought the ending with funeral was fantastic.,CAST#PERFORMANCE,Positive
It was awesome. Kind of sad about Ironman and Captain America.,CAST#PERFORMANCE,Positive
It all ended the way it began. What happens next? With Spider-Man far from home on it's way it feels like watching the first iron man. Where does the Marvel Universe go next. Would love to see the Fantastic Four and Doctor Doom reintroduced!,CAST#PERFORMANCE,Positive
"Been a long time that I laughed, cheered and several times found myself tearing up. I liked everthing about this movie. The Dark Knight was my all time favorite Comic Book movie. It has been replaced. Downey Jr. should get an Oscar nomination. Legit give him one. From story, SFX and acting this is a great achievement.",CAST#PERFORMANCE,Positive
"::SPOILERS::A fitting end/new beginning in many ways. I absolutely loved Tony Stark and Steve Rogers story arcs. My only complaint is a minor one Bucky Barnes was the first to carry the torch passed on by Steve Rogers, taking on the Mantle of Captain America. Sam/Falcon would eventually take over as Cap, but why not pass it to Bucky first? Ah, well. Overall, it was a GREAT conclusion to this phase of the MCU.",CAST#PERFORMANCE,Positive
"Was a bit disappointed with the movie given how perfect Infinity War was. It's too lengthy. The fat Thor jokes were redundant, and did not pack the same emotional punch like Tony's and Cap's storylines. However, it's a perfect send-off to the fans with many Easter Eggs and references.",CAST#PERFORMANCE,Positive
"Every Marvel character was connected to Endgames plot. Bittersweet to see Downey, Johansson, and Evans retire from their characters. With a lot on my plate, it took Fathers Day to give me a moment to watch this great picture.",CAST#PERFORMANCE,Positive
Liked when Stark met his dad and when everyone was brought back to fight.,CAST#PERFORMANCE,Positive
"I'm not a big fan of Marvel or DC. Please don't come for me! I'm trying! I came to see this movie because my niece is a huge fan. Anyway, I LOVED this movie! Did not feel like a 3 hour movie at all! I'm a little disappointed at shirtless Thor but other than that I loved it, and yes for those wondering I too cried! I know enough about these characters that when Captain America was worthy of the Hammer I literally gasped! ""I love you 3000""",CAST#PERFORMANCE,Positive
"Not a big fan of this genre, but this was entertaining. A fellow employee asked if I cried with Iron Man died! She did, I didn't. But she's a huge fan. Hey, if Downey wants to do another one in ten years, they'll find a way to bring IM back.",CAST#PERFORMANCE,Positive
This movie had it all. Every thing was spectacular. This is one of the most emotional marvel movies ever. Robert Downey junior should get a Oscar for this role.,CAST#PERFORMANCE,Positive
"Larger, Stronger, BetterTo say about the film that seals the ""Avengers"" series, that he met all expectations - will be an understatement. ""The Avengers: The End of the Game"" is visually spectacular, moving to tears, and has managed to connect the dozens of characters and plots of the past decade in an extraordinary way. And the length? Three hours like Thanap's fingers pass through Thanos's fingers.",CAST#PERFORMANCE,Positive
"Perfect ending to an outstanding narrative and unprecedented filmmaking and storytelling. I cannot even describe how much I love this movie. It was everything I wanted it to be and so much more. From the fantastic acting (especially by Robert Downey, Jr.) to the incredible payoffs that will probably never be matched, as well as the smart storyline, this is both the perfect endgame to the saga and the perfect open door for the beginning of whatÃ‚â€™s next on MarvelÃ‚â€™s plate to churn out.",CAST#PERFORMANCE,Positive
"Great movie. There was so much to like about this film - from Tony Stark teaching Nebula to play football (transported me back to the 80s middle school years!) to the brief exploration into the various characters emotional states as they advance the story line. Superbly acted. Marvel has a way of making the characters relatable, which is what I find makes the movies so enjoyable. Theyre beings who are deeply flawed and are aware of their shortcomings regardless of their outward persona.",CAST#PERFORMANCE,Positive
"Without Black Widow, Iron Man, and Thor on vacations, this Franchise is doomed, This movie was one of their finests!",CAST#PERFORMANCE,Positive
"A perfect way to end what MCU fans have loved the past 10 years. My wife & I balled our eyes out for Iron Man. The look on his daughter's face made us a wreck. Can't wait for this movie to come out on Digital, I'll be watching it non-stop like I did for Infinity War. I'll be fast forwarding through all the Captain Marvel scenes & most definitely the scene where all the women come together during the battle. It was completely unnecessary, out of place, & just takes you away from the emotional state invested into the movie.",CAST#PERFORMANCE,Positive
"Comic book basically was something that surrounded my childhood. I remember getting my allowance and walking hours to the nearest comic shop store to follow Marvel West Coast Avengers, Spider-Man, Hulk, Wolverine and Chris C's writing on the X-men. Now years later I met Stan Lee in person and saw Avengers: Endgame in IMAX 3D and in 4Dx. This film perfectly wraps up every story arc from the past MCU movies and brings the journey of the six original Avengers either full circle, a demise, or a happy ending. Exept where is Quicksilver? Why didn't Scarletwitch absolutely mention they should bring her brother back from the dead? Only really a few things bothering me about this film. I really was hoping to see a 'homage' to Grey Hulk or an angry furious Hulk fighting Thanos for the second time. Rather then where that character of Hulk was sort of sidelined and confirmated in smarts alone. We also never had the pleasure of seeing a real life version on Hawkeye's original Hawkeye mask. I'm sure a realistic way of emplimenting this can be included in someway. This could have been shown so it can be passed down to his daughter later on in future content.",CAST#PERFORMANCE,Positive
"I liked that they went back to the past to get the stones, I didnÃ‚â€™t like that black widow died for the soul stone. I didnÃ‚â€™t like that Thor was fat and looked like melted ice cream. I really hated that tony starks had to died to save everyone. Great performance by Robert Downey jr",CAST#PERFORMANCE,Positive
"Avengers endgame is one of the most amazing experiences I have ever had in a theater, seeing the ending to a decade of my favorite franchise is a feeling that I will never get again. The movies are full of references, action and moments that had left us crying. While the movie presents some scenes that may be incoherent or even kind of dumb, for example, Tony finding time travel extremely fast. The movie has the best final action scene in all of the Marvel movies.",CAST#PERFORMANCE,Positive
This film was absolutely amazing! Watching this film was very entertaining! It was full of many surprises as you see the Avengers battle out Thanos and his army.  This film is very fun to watch with your family or friends! I will definitely go to see it again and I definitely encourage for you to see it as well.,CAST#PERFORMANCE,Positive
"""Avengers Endgame"" truly does feel like the end of the MCU as we know it, and what a movie to end the first 22 films of this incredible franchise. Of course there will be more Marvel movies to come, and I have faith in Marvel that they will continue to make spectacular and fun movies, but I do have a hard time seeing them being able to come close to the closing salvo that was ""Infinity War"" and ""End Game"". Every actor gives a strong performance, with the stand out being Robert Downey Jr. who gives one of the finest performances in a blockbuster film that we will ever see. Highly recommended, and a must see for fans of Marvel.",CAST#PERFORMANCE,Positive
"Long movie that didn't seem unnecessarily so. Wrapped up the Thanos story, and gave Captain America a good closing story",CAST#PERFORMANCE,Positive
"Loved it! Disappointed with Ironman's death, but I believe he will be back. Enjoyed every character, good and bad. Just really enjoyed this movie.",CAST#PERFORMANCE,Positive
"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie  Sad that Iron Man and Black Widow had to perish in the process, but was thrilled when many of the Avengers returned and vanquished Thanos and his ilk..",CAST#PERFORMANCE,Positive
It was long and a little slow in parts. But it was good to get the rest of the Thanos story. Of course the options are left open for future Avengers.,CAST#PERFORMANCE,Positive
"Couldn't have been better!! Could have been 5 hours long! I, like everyone else, loved it 3000!!! If Thor had asked for a White Russian to complete his transformation into The Big Lebowski's son!!!",CAST#PERFORMANCE,Positive
I really enjoyed the movie. Fat Thor was funny. It was almost like they ruined hulk by making banner embrace the hulk. But I will see again.,CAST#PERFORMANCE,Positive
"Seen it 4 times, including the rerelease. Everytime  I've had my eyes start watering. Must have been someone cutting onions in the theatre. The pase is smooth with great transitions. Dialog is almost perfect. Thanos has some great lines.",CAST#PERFORMANCE,Positive
don't get mistaken by this one star.  the movie was great I loved it.  the end credits  the first one and the third one we're good the middle one they could have added a different one instead like Iron Man's daughter cutscene. it's Marvel I was expecting big things forties and credits!,CAST#PERFORMANCE,Positive
The re-release was awesome! great Stan Lee tribute! loved the Spiderman clip! saw it 5 times in theaters! Can't wait for Bluray!,CAST#PERFORMANCE,Positive
