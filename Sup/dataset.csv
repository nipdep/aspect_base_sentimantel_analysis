"Â‘Endgame' more than lives up to the hype. After almost 11 years, the Russo Brothers have delivered the thrilling conclusion to ""The Infinity Saga."" From sorrow to joy, fright to amazement, Â‘Endgame' is an emotional rollercoaster that perfectly wraps up 21 films of storytelling. #MyThreeCents | 4Â•26Â•19",DIRECTING#PERFORMANCE,Positive
The most epic 4th installment of Marvel's The Avengers. In loving memory of Stan Lee,WRITING#PERFORMANCE,Positive
I'd give it a 10 if they didn't completely screw over the Hulk yet again.,CAST#PERFORMANCE,Positive
"I thought it was a Fantastic Movie. Well done, polished and capped off the Inifinity Saga for the MCU. However, I can only give it a 4/5 stars because I thought Marvel completely botched the ending. If I had done it I would have had Captain America do the Ultimate Snap to destroy Thanos and have Tony walk off into retirement to raise his family. I do understand why they killed Tony, I really do, but that doesn't mean I have to like their decision. If Cap had done the snap it would have allowed both Chris Evans and Robert Downey Jr. to leave the MCU. It would have allowed for a really good end credit scene to set up the next Iron Man in the future!",CAST#PERFORMANCE,Positive
I recently watched this movie again and found that I liked it MUCH better the second time around. Great acting and a great end to the story.,CAST#PERFORMANCE,Positive
"The epic conclusion to an 22 film story arc that started with Iron Man. While the MCU is not perfect, this is by far Marvel's best film so far. The emotionally driven scenes just hits you so hard in both the beginning and the end. The final battle at the end delivers everything fans want, and the fan service is all over. The performances are amazing in these movies as always, the effects are mind blowing, the action sequences are entertaining. For a three hour movie, you definitely won't get bored by this film.",CAST#PERFORMANCE,Positive
"this movie was an incredible wrap up to the first 10 years of the mcu. this movie does INCREDIBLE fan service, and has many flashbacks to previous films. do not watch this movie if you have not seen infinity war! robert downey jr., scarlett johansson, chris evans, mark ruffalo, karen gillan, josh brolin, and zoe saldana are the standouts of the film.",CAST#PERFORMANCE,Positive
"Wish Thanos wasnÂ’t killed in the beginning but, overall was good.",CAST#PERFORMANCE,Positive
"Great movie, the perfect closing for this amazing phase, and specially a brilliant ending for the legend Iron man, overall is a 90% of 100 and 4.5 stars out of 5",CAST#PERFORMANCE,Positive
"Endgame is the culmination of the Infinity Saga's 10 year run of MCU films. It's a massive film, filled with amazing visual effects, tons of fan service, great action sequences, and a terrific sendoff for a beloved character. 'I am Iron Man' will forever be immortalized as the most badass superhero moment in the entire MCU, bar none. Once again, the Russo brothers did a fantastic job balancing tone throughout the film. Despite the gloom that completely enveloped the first 30 minutes or so of the film, they managed to add in a few lighthearted moments that set the stage for future tonal shifts in the film. I felt the humor was welcomed and, at times, downright hilarious. Steve Rogers v. Steve Rogers is a moment most soon won't forget. And that is most definitely America's ass (trademark). However, though the fan service was excellent, it severely detracts from the re-watch potential of the film. I was surprised, elated, and emotionally fulfilled from my first watch-through and the countless fan service moments will never have that same impact upon re-watching the movie (which is why I will likely never watch it again). The emotional moments were fully earned and I cried in the theater (it was the cheeseburger line), something that rarely happens to me. After 10 years of watching these characters grow and interact with one another, I felt that the arcs for Tony and Steve were perfect in every which way. Also, I'm proud to say that I predicted the final shots of the film between Peggy and Steve and I still get chills thinking about it. The Russo brothers created the perfect culminating film for the MCU but unfortunately, the over-abundance of fan-service makes this an impossible film to enjoy more than once and for me, detracts from the overall score. Nevertheless, this is still a great MCU film and the Russos have more than earned their rest.",PERFOMANCE#GENERAL,Positive
"YouÂ’ll love this movie 3,000. An emotional and satisfying conclusion to the Infinity Saga. Very good screenplay, score, and visual effects. The performances of Robert Downey Jr, Chris Evans, Chris Hemsworth, Scarlett Johansson, Jeremy Renner, Paul Rudd, Karen Gillan, and Don Cheadle were exceptional. The motion capture performances of Mark Ruffalo and Josh Brolin were also exceptional as was the voice performance of Bradley Cooper. Credit the directors Joe and Anthony Russo and Kevin Feige and the entire team at Marvel Studios for orchestrating this film and making it come to life. The biggest movie youÂ’ll ever see and many characters arcs are wrapped up in the film. Credit to Marvel Studios for creating something that will probably never be replicated again in film industry.",PERFOMANCE#GENERAL,Positive
"A fantastic conclusion to ten years of these unique act-packed films. The Russo brothers once again bring an epic showdown with our favorite heroes. The movie isn't necessarily a cult classic what with it breaking box office records and what not, but wrapping up ten years of relatable, colorful, and well-directed action films is certainly something to go for. It's hard telling exactly what will happen next when it comes to the future success of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, but it's likely not going to top the current momentum for a while, if ever. Overall, the film has a fairly complex yet understandable storyline and is pretty unpredictable at times. It should remain quite a classic to MCU fans like myself and not just Marvel fans in general (i.e. comic books, Stan Lee, etc.).",CREW#PERFORMANCE,Positive
"It was a fun film to go see, although the use of time travel and the microverse were not as complicated or extensive as I had hoped they would be. The Hulk was another no show sadly. I felt like they moved a little too fast to get Thanos to earth on the other hand they started the movie off too slow to make room for Miss Marvels entrance. There were also moments of feminist wokeness that made the movie less watchable then it could have been but all in all not a bad effort at all.",CAST#PERFORMANCE,Positive
"Great way to end the storyline of Thanos, brings you everything you expect and more!",CAST#PERFORMANCE,Positive
Ironman and Captain America are overrated even they are less powerful and Thor and Hulk are underrated which reduces its connection with its prequel AVENGERS : INFINITY WAR,CAST#PERFORMANCE,Negative
"It had good graphics, and there were a few parts that were really good. Natasha's sacrifice being one of them. But there were soooo many things wrong with the conclusion to a decades worth of movies. Smart!Hulk was the dumbest choice they ever made. They could have made it cool, but instead, chose to make him basically worthless. Playing off Thor's depression as a joke was crass and uncalled for. The girl power moment was not empowering, it felt forced. Steve's ending was a complete setback to his character development. Gay Joe Russo??? Really??? I'm supposed to be impressed that they included a gay character for 30 seconds and it was Joe Russo? Yeah, not impressed. Bucky getting an itsy bitsy amount of screentime. Antman was funny, as always. Tony's death was touching, even though he's my least favorite character for a lot of reasons. Overall, would I watch this again? My answer is a definitive no. There were more things wrong with this movie than there were right. I'm pretending the last ten minutes didn't happen. That Captain America didn't turn into a selfish jerk and go back to the past, forcing Peggy to choose him. He still could have retired without resorting to running away. The best thing to come out of this movie is the Falcon and Winter Soldier television show. Will never see anything by the Russo brothers again because of how bad they screwed up so many characters.",PERFOMANCE#GENERAL,Negative
"Excellent, amazing, and more spectacular. The movie is good for the final epic of Marvel cinematic universe for phase 3. And for Tony Stark "" I so Miss you and may God bless you always """,CAST#PERFORMANCE,Positive
"I don't know how to feel about this movie at all! On one hand, I really liked Steve's story and ending, him passing the shield to Sam, Tony's death was wonderfully done, Ant-Man was entertaining as usual. I also really liked all the Time Travel stuff, which was really cool and made total sense to me. But on the other hand, there were so many things I hated. Bucky being snubbed, Thanos in general sucked, the ""girl squad"" moment, all of Rhodey's jokes, Captain Marvel showing up to save everyone, everything that happened to Thor... It's all just really bad and really good. I can't make up my mind.",CAST#PERFORMANCE,Negative
Plot was recycled from Back to The Future and the Hulk was character was the weakest and worst part of the movie . The best action Was the last 30 minutes of the movie . This movie was overrated and I went to see it because I thought it Would be as good as infinity war .,CAST#PERFORMANCE,Negative
"You simply can't introduce time travel in the Final Episode. You can't undo all the deaths as if they were nothing; I did read a book about the history of Marvel comics where Stan Lee wanted to sell the illusion of change and while this is exactly that. I'm allowed to jot like the core idea of what Stan Lee wanted from Marvel. I side more with Jack Kirby on wanting my movies with real irreversible changes.In some interview they tried to explain away the plotholes with the infamous phrase: ""A wizard did it"" from the Xhena parody Q&A from the Simpsons Tree House of Horror's Halloween episode.When it comes to Marvel crossover conclusions involving time travel; X-men Days of Future Past (specially the eXtentded Rogue Cut) is better than this. Also the Back to the Future this movie jokes about and tries to homage; is a thousand years better than this, Avengers Endgame is the Jaws XXII that Back to the Future II joked would happen in the future.Marvel has not only jumped the Shark; it has jumped the Fonzy as shown by the prequel Captain Marvel showing a fight on space above Fonzy merchandise. I don't understand why people aren't angry. But as someone who likes grounded movies i didn't liked this.The way time travel is done; it tries to survive on nostalgia rather than earning a good story. I didn't liked most of the uneven MCU prequels; so this feels unearned. Also the Hawkeye kids would of had been better orphan, than raised by a Punisher turned vengeful bloody cold killer Hawkeye father. The film sacrificed; and that's the thing, characters never face consequences. We never see what they learned, they just win because they had time-travel but they never overcome their personal flaws on the way the adult-kids from IT do (without overcoming any specific flaws; all characters are interchangeable and that makes the movie worse).The worse example of characters not learning anything is Captain America, even if one simpatizes with him missing his girl that got away. Creating an alternative timeline to be with her is creepy and unethical; specially because she had already aged and died of natural causes; after having a life of her own. Is wrong, also I mean they altered some timelines which is wrong. Normal time travel mechanics would had been better. I don't know it feels like they won by cheating, because they won without personal growing up and maturing if feels unearned and hollow (Star Wars III: Revenge of the Sith failure in comparison to the victory in VI: Return of the Jedi a great example of overcoming flaws and winning, even if JJ Abrams is such a bad writet that IX:Rise of Skywalker has the characters winning by doing the exact same things deemed as failures in the previous movies).2019 was a year of lackluster endings; part of the problem of reviving characters is that the ""death"" always feels fake. The positive thing I can say is the acting is good, the MCU VFX designs have always been to cartoonish for my taste; even if the effects are good. I would say too much CGI. The worst part is that the generic debris was so generic that action was hard to follow; hard to know where anyone was standing and thus what was happening.I feel that the criticized Godzilla King of the Monster handled the envioremental storyline, which I feel should had been the core of this movie; so much better. The population measure control there is Godzilla and the deaths are permanent; accepted and the villian wins because the enviorement is shown less contaminated where Godzilla attacked. Godzilla justified the villian attack by saying human overpopulation causes contamination; whereas Thanos motivations get lost due to this Sequel forgetting them completely and turning him into a generic villian.",PERFOMANCE#GENERAL,Negative
"The best movie in the MCU. It took all the build up from the last 11 years of the MCU and delivered one of the most epic, emotional and crowd-pleasing movies that Marvel has made. No characters feel underutilised, the time-heist is entertaining and has tons of MCU callbacks and Professor Hulk is a great change up for the character. The final battle is one of my favourite scenes in any movie as it takes all the characters we know and love (including Howard the Duck!) into one epic finale against one of the most iconic movie villains ever. Fat Thor is frustrating and Thanos does become very underdeveloped compared to Infinity War, but neither of these complaints really bother me that much. Endgame is incredible!",CAST#PERFORMANCE,Positive
"This movie honestly bored me, It didn't fulfil my expectations. Infinity war was a lot better in my opinion. The final battle really sucked because nothing really happens at all. You could have removed Thanos his army and nothing would've really changed. And I personally really hate Captain Marvel in this movie.I also think that Thanos isn't as interesting as in Infinity War, I understand that Infinity War was the movie where they were really focussing on Thanos but in Endgame Thanos isn't as interesting.",CAST#PERFORMANCE,Negative
"Having lost someone close to me with the simultaneous mixture of long and drawn out and extremely quickly as certain diseases will do; I found Avengers Endgame difficult to watch but only because it was beautiful and painful.There are two ways to enjoy this movie, one as a fun time heist, throwback, exciting blockbuster with some snappy oneliners and a healthy dose of gloss, the closure of some main character arcs and some significant resolution (although also with a heady dose of sequel potential of course.). The other way to view this movie is a movie in touch with the heart of grief and loss, and also just losing. It's deeply sad throughout and people try to put a brave face on as you do, but grief is no slouch and it clearly takes constant work for them all just to buck up and rally around another one of sad-faced Captain America's many speeches. It all culminates in the death of Iron Man and the eventual death of Captain America and both men get what they want. Lives without all this pain; The burden of responsibility and honour. When Stark dies it's quick but it feels earned, and when Potts leans in to him and allows him to go, he doesn't register anything on his face because he's dying. But you hope he registers it somewhere before he does. I'd need to see it again to appreciate the nuances and the Easter eggs but I was profoundly moved by watching these people (characters) we know well by now, in the kinds of pain we will all go through. And strangely it overtook my experience of the movie but not in a bad way. So I gave it 5 stars. When I wash it clean from my mind and watch it again. I'll be able to assess its many levels, achievements and flaws. But as a film about loss. It's superbly layered and surprisingly effective and therefore I say it's pretty much succeeded on a human level. For something with a massive green dude in spectacles and fat Thor in it, that's saying something.",CAST#PERFORMANCE,Positive
"Is this an Avengers movie or an Iron Man movie? In certain moments I guess it's about Captain America too, just this",CAST#PERFORMANCE,Negative
"Good movie, I hated to see what happened to Ironman in the end.",CAST#PERFORMANCE,Positive

Why oh IRON MAN... WHY??? :-:,CAST#PERFORMANCE,Negative
"While some call this a masterpiece and others think it's only decent and saved by the finale, I am in between these two groups. While I was entertained by many scenes before the final act like those with time travel, I do feel that there are some major flaws. Some flaws are the slow pacing in the beginning, the lack of character development for the heroes and Thanos, the unfortunate focus on the bland Nebula, and the last 15 minutes after the final battle that really drag. I feel that 2/3 of this movie is Marvel at its finest while the rest is mediocre. I don't hate anything about this film which is why it warrants a 9 out o 10, but the flaws keep it from being Marvel's best work.",CAST#PERFORMANCE,Negative

"To say nothing of the hardness, Russo Brothers have a whole army of superheroes to introduce. This might be a reason that Avengers: End Game is not eligibly a thought-provoking one by the comparison of their earlier films. It is an electrifying film. However, It could be epic. Anyway, I love you three thousand.",DIRECTING#PERFORMANCE,Positive

"I have heard a lot of complaints about pandering to the masses,  but I think that the creators of the MCU tried to honor the fans. I have seen this 4 times in the theater. I haven't done that since the original release of Return of the Jedi.",CAST#PERFORMANCE,Positive
"Took two of my boys to see it and we loved it!  It was long... and I may or may not have dozed off for about 15 minutes in the middle... but I picked up right where I left off upon awakening )  LOTS to follow in this movie... can be confusing at times...but it definitely doesn't take away from the overall movie.  Very emotional scenes towards the end.  Love these characters... loved the movie and highly recommend it!PS - Chris Pratt and his ""new crew"" are a MUST for a future movie )",CAST#PERFORMANCE,Positive
"I did not like how Thor went into some tailspin after Infinity War and let himself go. Not believable at all. He lost everything in other movies and never spiraled like that. Also, the Avengers has almost defeated Tjanos in Infinity War even with all of the stones and now all of the sudden he was even more powerful than before. Didnt buy it!  Was disappointing.",CAST#PERFORMANCE,Negative
"I had to double-check to make sure I had the right movie when I saw these approval ratings.  This movie was tedious, predictable, garbled, un-smart, trite, boring, and those were its good points.  Robert Downey Jr. asking for a picture of an inverted mobius strip and saying that he understands time travel.  I mean, Far Out, Man.  God, I wish I were that smart.",CAST#PERFORMANCE,Negative
The time travel gimmick.  It started the shark jump on Star Trek.  it made Superman (1978 version) irrelevant.  Anything can be reversed.  Life and death battles are not.  Brilliant visuals-silly and inconsistent plot.  Must-see for any Marvelite but disappointing all the same.,CAST#PERFORMANCE,Negative
"Absolutely incredible movie from start to finish. Even if a scene in the movie seemed predictable, Joe and Anthony Russo made it epic and emotional as they always do. It was a truly gratifying cinematic event to experience on opening weekend and it is definitely my favorite MCU movie and favorite movie of all time.",DIRECTING#PERFORMANCE,Positive
"3 hours....it took 3 hours....unfortunately I was not blown away with this. There are some major plot flaws and ""well that is stupid"" moments. Then there is the ""Girl Power Segment"" which seemed ridiculous. You will ask why didn't Capt Marvel snap her fingers or why not go back further and put a pillow over baby Thanos....any movies dealing with time travel always seem to really suck as it never makes any sense at all in the end and that it why this movie seemed  more like an attempt to put it all to bed and end it allready...than the blockbuster I hoped for....oh and THREE HOURS....wear some depends....",CAST#PERFORMANCE,Negative
"An extremely solid ending to the first waves of Marvel movies. Not perfect. Not as good as Infinity War or Civil War or Winter Soldier, but sits just behind them with Guardians of the Galaxy, the first Iron Man and just ahead of Black Panther. Most likely you've already seen it. I'm going to see it one more time in the theater before the summer is over.",CAST#PERFORMANCE,Positive
Tony Strak and the black widows death!,CAST#PERFORMANCE,Neutral
"Finale to a great series, it could have used some editing but a satisfying conclusion to the franchise. Could have done without the politically correct ""empowered women super heroes"" 5 second clip, (because what? They are empowered women super heroes already) but if they were going to go there I wish they would have made it a longer segment and had the women interact while defeating the bad guys. (Like Thor using his hammer to pound on Captain America's shield to flatten the bad guys, etc.)",CAST#PERFORMANCE,Positive
It's an absolute must see.  Hats off to Kevin Feige and the Russo Brothers for pulling off a movie full of emotion and fun.  It was truly an epic conclusion to the 10 year story.  Will see again.,DIRECTING#PERFORMANCE,Positive

"Very good way to wrap up the Avengers Universe. Drunken Thor was a little cheesy, Very well acted suburb story line,",CAST#PERFORMANCE,Positive
"Now this is the way to end a franchise! not everything happens the way you wanted, but it still happens an understandably organic way, consistent with itself. The character arcs are beautifully tied up. They could have blown it trying to force the Captain Marvel narrative, but fortunately for us all they didn't. We need to enjoy this. Star trek, Star wars, Ghostbusters, game of thrones, walking Dead, and all other franchises need to take note that this is how it's done.",CAST#PERFORMANCE,Positive
"Endgame is the culmination of 22 films in the MCU and bringing an end to the stories of some characters. The film takes a focus on the survivors of ""The Snap"" and the original six Avengers. Some characters such as Captain Marvel and Okoye are barely in it, but the film makes up for it by heavily featuring Iron Man, Captain America, Ant-Man, Hulk, Hawkeye, Black Widow, Thor, Rocket, Nebula, and War Machine. It creates a visceral adventure that highlights the major moments of the MCU so far and sets up future instalments. The final hour is some of the greatest moments ever put to screen and will create a truly memorable and moving adventure that will more than meet even the most sceptical fan's expectations.",CAST#PERFORMANCE,Positive
This movie only gets 5 stars because the legend of Tony Stark will always live on! He's my favorite!!!,CAST#PERFORMANCE,Positive
"Fantastic.  Under utilized Captain Marvel a bit, but still a great send off for Iron Man and Captain America!",CAST#PERFORMANCE,Positive
"one of the worse A movies. In general presence of ultimate superhero (like Marvel) creates an awkward limitation - she can solve any conflict but doesn't because she's ... busy elsewhere! Wow. Such originality! AND as a nerd, I refuse to accept the logic of single timeline surviving the destruction of past Thanos in the future (that's a major logic flaw). But the most sacrilegious was the fact that Cap took possession of Thor's hummer. Seriously? decades of philosophical debates resulting in this?Lastly - the last fragment of the movie was for totally dumb people. I mean is there anyone who couldn't piece together that aging Cap decided to make America Great Again (different America) and stay with his girlfriend? I mean next time they should RE-PE-AT words so we'd better understand the plot.",CAST#PERFORMANCE,Negative
"First two hours were very slow. Time travel plot holes amok. Not a fan of Fat Thor (and not for politically correct reasons; simply a whiny, unlikeable version of Thor) and Professor Hulk was essentially a non-factor. Iron Man's sendoff could have packed more emotion. Humor was lacking. Felt more like a Fox/Sony Marvel movie than an MCU movie. An overall letdown.",CAST#PERFORMANCE,Negative
"Captain America, Iron Man, Hulk, Thor etc ...Super heroes in a super movie. Loved the special effects, the action,. The UNSTEADY camera work towards the last hour of the movie, did not help the movie, it distracted from it. I hated some of the poor camera work.",CAST#PERFORMANCE,Negative

I loved the music.  Sad when Iron Man died but thought the ending with funeral was fantastic.,CAST#PERFORMANCE,Positive
"I think Hawkeye's scenes at beginning of the movie (when his family was dusted) and when he was fighting bad guys in Japan were unnecessary. Why? Because the prequel, Infinity War, had already shown the aftermath of Thanos snap. With that, it is understandable that people are sad, so it serves no purpose to show how this drove Hawkeye mad and end up killing bad guys in Japan. Instead, these scenes should be replaced with longer fighting scene when Thanos and his troops arrived on Earth. The fighting scene is the most crucial part which get the audiences' adrenaline pumping. Perhaps it should include fighting scene between Marvel superheroes with Children of Thanos such as Ebony Maw & Proxima Midnight. Maybe MCU should shoot this and relaunch an extended version. Pretty sure if this happens, Endgame will easily cross US$3 billion mark worldwide.",CAST#PERFORMANCE,Negative

About an hour and a half too long. Unnecessary chatter.No explanation as to when Piper got a Iron Man suit.,CAST#PERFORMANCE,Negative
It was fun to watch and was a reasonable enough conclusion to the MCU but it really didn't work for me.  Time travel was too easy of a contrivance to even seem plausible and it created lots of unexplainable paradoxes for alternate timelines that couldn't be explained away as easily as the film tried to do.  I thought Chris Hemsworth really showed his chops in this movie but the rest is kind've meh.  Infinity War was far better.,CAST#PERFORMANCE,Negative
"::SPOILERS::A fitting end/new beginning in many ways. I absolutely loved Tony Stark and Steve Rogers story arcs. My only complaint is a minor one Bucky Barnes was the first to carry the torch passed on by Steve Rogers, taking on the Mantle of Captain America. Sam/Falcon would eventually take over as Cap, but why not pass it to Bucky first? Ah, well. Overall, it was a GREAT conclusion to this phase of the MCU.",CAST#PERFORMANCE,Positive
"Was a bit disappointed with the movie given how perfect Infinity War was. It's too lengthy. The fat Thor jokes were redundant, and did not pack the same emotional punch like Tony's and Cap's storylines. However, it's a perfect send-off to the fans with many Easter Eggs and references.",CAST#PERFORMANCE,Positive

"So disapointed with this film. The end sure is epic, but it doesnÂ´t feel fresh, new or epic. 2/3 of the film are absolutely boring. Also, the treatment to some of the main characters (poor Black Widow compared to Iron Man, for example) feels embarrasing.",CAST#PERFORMANCE,Negative
"Not a big fan of this genre, but this was entertaining. A fellow employee asked if I cried with Iron Man died! She did, I didn't. But she's a huge fan. Hey, if Downey wants to do another one in ten years, they'll find a way to bring IM back.",CAST#PERFORMANCE,Positive
This movie had it all. Every thing was spectacular. This is one of the most emotional marvel movies ever. Robert Downey junior should get a Oscar for this role.,CAST#PERFORMANCE,Positive
"Larger, Stronger, BetterTo say about the film that seals the ""Avengers"" series, that he met all expectations - will be an understatement. ""The Avengers: The End of the Game"" is visually spectacular, moving to tears, and has managed to connect the dozens of characters and plots of the past decade in an extraordinary way. And the length? Three hours like Thanap's fingers pass through Thanos's fingers.",CAST#PERFORMANCE,Positive
"Perfect ending to an outstanding narrative and unprecedented filmmaking and storytelling. I cannot even describe how much I love this movie. It was everything I wanted it to be and so much more. From the fantastic acting (especially by Robert Downey, Jr.) to the incredible payoffs that will probably never be matched, as well as the smart storyline, this is both the perfect endgame to the saga and the perfect open door for the beginning of whatÂ’s next on MarvelÂ’s plate to churn out.",CAST#PERFORMANCE,Positive
Too many repetitive speeches by Thanos. The rest is for the viewers to decide.,CAST#PERFORMANCE,Negative
"Great movie. There was so much to like about this film - from Tony Stark teaching Nebula to play football (transported me back to the 80s middle school years!) to the brief exploration into the various characters emotional states as they advance the story line. Superbly acted. Marvel has a way of making the characters relatable, which is what I find makes the movies so enjoyable.

"A perfect way to end what MCU fans have loved the past 10 years. My wife & I balled our eyes out for Iron Man. The look on his daughter's face made us a wreck. Can't wait for this movie to come out on Digital, I'll be watching it non-stop like I did for Infinity War. I'll be fast forwarding through all the Captain Marvel scenes & most definitely the scene where all the women come together during the battle. It was completely unnecessary, out of place, & just takes you away from the emotional state invested into the movie.",CAST#PERFORMANCE,Positive
"Comic book basically was something that surrounded my childhood. I remember getting my allowance and walking hours to the nearest comic shop store to follow Marvel West Coast Avengers, Spider-Man, Hulk, Wolverine and Chris C's writing on the X-men. Now years later I met Stan Lee in person and saw Avengers: Endgame in IMAX 3D and in 4Dx. This film perfectly wraps up every story arc from the past MCU movies and brings the journey of the six original Avengers either full circle, a demise, or a happy ending. Exept where is Quicksilver? Why didn't Scarletwitch absolutely mention they should bring her brother back from the dead? Only really a few things bothering me about this film. I really was hoping to see a 'homage' to Grey Hulk or an angry furious Hulk fighting Thanos for the second time. Rather then where that character of Hulk was sort of sidelined and confirmated in smarts alone. We also never had the pleasure of seeing a real life version on Hawkeye's original Hawkeye mask. I'm sure a realistic way of emplimenting this can be included in someway. This could have been shown so it can be passed down to his daughter later on in future content.",CAST#PERFORMANCE,Positive
"I liked that they went back to the past to get the stones, I didnÂ’t like that black widow died for the soul stone. I didnÂ’t like that Thor was fat and looked like melted ice cream.

"Avengers endgame is one of the most amazing experiences I have ever had in a theater, seeing the ending to a decade of my favorite franchise is a feeling that I will never get again. The movies are full of references, action and moments that had left us crying. While the movie presents some scenes that may be incoherent or even kind of dumb, for example, Tony finding time travel extremely fast. The movie has the best final action scene in all of the Marvel movies.",CAST#PERFORMANCE,Positive

"I am not insane of this like everyone else.  Infinity wars was far far better.  This movie seem to drag quite a bit for me, from the first 2 hours of figuring how to get the stones to reverse what Thanos did in 1.  The interaction between Thanos and Avengers is far less enticing in this movie.  The action, plot and story seem to move along at a descent pace, but you already know what is going to happen, it seems like they could have done much better.  One of my biggest problems is the fact that The Hulk is once again a non factor joke.  He is the most powerful Avenger, yet he is sidelined for Antman?  I do like the movie but it is a far let down after the last movie without a doubt.",CAST#PERFORMANCE,Negative
Years of MCU movies have all been building to this moment and I could not have been happier. The Russo brothers knock this one out of the park. Acting is fantastic and action even better. Can be a little slow at first but the payoff is worth it.,DIRECTING#PERFORMANCE,Positive
"""Avengers Endgame"" truly does feel like the end of the MCU as we know it, and what a movie to end the first 22 films of this incredible franchise. Of course there will be more Marvel movies to come, and I have faith in Marvel that they will continue to make spectacular and fun movies, but I do have a hard time seeing them being able to come close to the closing salvo that was ""Infinity War"" and ""End Game"". Every actor gives a strong performance, with the stand out being Robert Downey Jr. who gives one of the finest performances in a blockbuster film that we will ever see. Highly recommended, and a must see for fans of Marvel.",CAST#PERFORMANCE,Positive
"The first time I saw this movie, I didn't like it at all because I thought there was better directions that Marvel could have gone with the film. However, after watching it a couple more times, it truly does feel like a thank you letter to the fans that have stuck around since the beginning and have been going to watch the MCU unfold for 11 years. I am lucky enough to call myself one of those people and Avengers: Endgame has now become my favorite MCU film. There is so much emotion and excitement in this film and I truly hand it to Joe and Anthony Russo. They weren't just asked to create a satisfying closure to Endgame or Infinity War, they were asked to bring a closure to a franchise with 22 movies in it. The fact that that they even succeeded a little is really impressive. What makes it even more impressive is that this film didn't just succeed a little, it shattered box office records and became a fan favorite. If anyone is planning to watch Endgame that enjoys Marvel but has not seen all of the movies, I encourage you to watch all of the movies before Endgame, because you will have a spectacular and mind blowing experience if you do.",DIRECTING#PERFORMANCE,Positive

I love Avengers movies 3000. But I love Iron Man the most. So I hate the ending to Endgame. The only part of the extra minutes added was the Stan Lee tribute.

"5 stars for the movie that was released in April 2019. One star for the version released in late June 2019. The April release delivered on everything a movie could have weaving in all the different story lines and characters. The June 2019 re release was supposed to add in surprises, extra footage, end credits scene. It didn't. There was a Stan Lee tribute and a Spider Man Far From Home scene that we've seen half of in the trailer. VERY disappointing. I didn't see any additional footage beyond that. When seeing a movie more than once you start to notice holes in the plot. For instance, Thanos' whole premise doesn't make any sense. The world population in 1970 was half of what it is today. Why would wiping out half of the population help us? Is there mass starvation and suffering from lack of food? Not with commercial agriculture. So how could this genocide help a population? Especially wiping out half of all the livestock etc. Makes no sense... I of course didn't question it the first time I saw the movie.",PERFOMANCE#GENERAL,Negative

Liked how they brought it all together and stayed true to their original format. The comic book style worked really well and kept all the Marvel movies in sync. I especially enjoyed the Stan Lee cameos on each and every film and how they had a special piece at the end of this final Avengers movie to honor his memory.

Couldnt have expected the second watch to have been even better - beyond Easter eggs you can see how every relationship / character arc from Iron Man 1 has come to a conclusion.

We got a scene at the end that was cut however they didn't even finish the scene!  The CGI of Hulk was not the same quality of the movie and the lips weren't even moving with the dialogue.  I thought there would be more ""added scenes"" as advertised but not so much.",CAST#PERFORMANCE,Negative
"The perfect conclusion to the Infinity Saga. Endgame ties up the arcs of the original Avengers team in a beautiful way, while also getting the fan base excited for what comes next in the MCU's future.

For decades to come people will study what they did. Marvel, a company that declared bankruptcy in 1996, had to sell off some of its known characters and now has a fighting chance to own the highest grossing film of all time built from their lesser known characters. I don't believe another shared universe will ever succeed the way Marvel did.Footnote: I think the people who need to learn the biggest lesson from this is Star Wars and Disney. When they bought Marvel they said ""keep doing what you're doing"" and the passionate heads at Marvel succeeded in their long term goal of giving fans something truly satisfying, but when Disney bought Star Wars Disney said ""let's do whatever, because people will pay money no matter what"" and then they made that terrible movie.",CAST#PERFORMANCE,Positive

"I didn't like this movie. So many plot holes and plot points that are just confusing or forgotten by most. It's prequel, Avengers: Infinity War was a very good movie and built up so much for Avengers: Endgame and it was all just wasted. It should've been a darker movie like The Dark Knight or Logan, but the humor was going on the whole movie. Thor's ark was very useless and it should've changed either with the time machine that didn't work at the beginning of the film or right when Thor call's for Stormbreaker and Mjiolner. The Hulk and Hawkeye should've had at least one scene with thanos. We also should have had a mourning scene for Black Widow at Tony's house with Clint, Bruce, Steve, Nick Fury and maybe rhody to. The use of Okoye was also dissapointing.  I would've wanted her and Brie Larson's, Captain Marvel to go hunt down Thanos together or something that had to do with either of those characters in the 3 hours film. The only dramatic character arc was Nebula and now that Thanos is dead she'll have nothing to do besides join the Guardians of The Galaxy. Speaking of the Guardians, it was dumb to add Thor in and also Rocket was sad at the beginning because he lost all the family he ever had and then after the five year skip he's making jokes. Also, the re-release was horrible and it's a waste of money. The movie was very disappointing and I hope Spider-Man: Far From Home will be good.",PERFOMANCE#GENERAL,Negative

I couldn't have asked for a better conclusion for this 11 years adventure and the Russo Brothers really are amazinf directors. I did have a problem with Thor, I didn't like his personality in this film and thought that 'broken Thor' from Infinity War was a lot better. Also Professor Hulk was a dissapointment.

"Before I get into the nit-picking of this film, I want to make it clear that I thoroughly enjoyed myself in the theater. The movie got off to a perfect start and had me on the edge of my seat, and the ending was probably the best thing IÂ’ve ever seen in a theater. Overall, I loved it. It was emotional, truly shocking, and the PERFECT ending to this 20+ movie saga. Marvel did a great job with this franchise and they should be proud of creating a universe with this much depth and development, itÂ’s a truly remarkable feat!                But there were a lot of things I didnÂ’t love: Firstly, I think that everyone can agree the biggest drawback of Endgame was the lack of fighting. It took up until the final 40 minutes of the film for any real fight to break out. Up until then, it was mostly just story with no real action or risk whatsoever, which REALLY made the the second act drag. Which is fine, because story development is important, but being a superhero movie it was really disappointing we had to wait almost 2 hours and 30 minutes for any fight scene to occur (minus the cap vs cap fight which was decent at best, but definitely not a substitute for the lack of action).Secondly, I hated what they did to Thor. Being my favorite character in the MCU, I was really disappointed with how they utilized him in Endgame. Instead of using all the remorse he was filled with from Infinity War as fuel, they channeled it in a completely different direction and made him somewhat of a loser. Now IÂ’m not saying that being upset or depressed over a failure is something to be looked down upon, but for a character like Thor it made no sense to me. He had pretty much lost everything near and dear to him over the course of the MCU, but it never affected him to the point that he had given up on everything including himself, so it made no sense to me that he would suddenly change everything about himself and become far. I also felt like he was TOO comedic and wasnÂ’t serious enough. I may be alone on this but I just didnÂ’t understand why the RussoÂ’s chose to go this route with such a powerful and mentally strong character. It felt like everything Taika Waititi did in Ragnarok was just thrown down the drain and all of the development of the character was wasted. I enjoyed the joke at first, but I wanted to see Thor return back to his headstrong and confident self, which sadly didnÂ’t happen. Finally, my last issue arose with none other than the Incredible Hulk. My issue, however. was not so much with the characterÂ’s role and personality in the movie, but rather the fact that he got less than 30 seconds of on screen fighting time. ThatÂ’s right, we saw one of the most formidable and savage characters in the Marvel Universe fight on screen for less than 30 seconds. To me, this is one of the biggest failures of endgame. Hulk is one of the most well known, if not THE most well known, characters that Marvel has. At the end of the day, Professor or World Breaker, Hulk is Hulk and the fans want to see the angry green monster get some action which we really didnÂ’t get in this movie at all. It wouldÂ’ve been nice to see Banner get a rematch with Thanos or even get a crack at one of the members of the black order. Some more backstory on his transition to professor hulk would have been nice as well. But otherwise, I really liked his role and importance to the story (something I felt was absent in previous Avengers films) and IÂ’m excited to see this new persona play out in future films! So in conclusion, Endgame to me wasnÂ’t perfect like I thought it would be and I think there were a lot of things that couldÂ’ve been changed to make the film better. Regardless of all of these nitpicks, however, I still loved the film. So many moments and aspects of the film were done perfectly and had my draw dropping: Â•Thanos getting decapitated by Thor in the first 15 minutes which was then followed by a 5 year jumpÂ•Seeing Tony StarkÂ’s daughter for the first timeÂ•The reveal of Prof. HulkÂ•Seeing Valkyrie, Meek and KorgÂ•Fat Thor (even thought it was bittersweet)Â•The Ancient One CameoÂ•Thor getting Mjolnir backÂ•Tony getting to say bye to his dadÂ•The Trinity vs ThanosÂ•The Return of the dead AvengersÂ•Cap Wielding Mjolnir Â•Old Capand of course, everyoneÂ’s favoritesÂ•Â”AVENGERS!..... assemble!Â”Â•Â”And I.... am.... Iron ManÂ”I would definitely recommend seeing this movie, one of the most memorable moments of my life in a theater!Final Rating: 9.1/10",PERFOMANCE#GENERAL,Positive

"Absolutely trash for Marvel standards. It's lazy and the only reason why it was good was the CGI and most of the charater development. But even that wasn' the best. BTW, this review contians from here on out. Captian Marvel was pretty good, only for the action sence. Only than that, her story wasn't that good. Got to expect that from her movie. When Iron Man and Nebula were stuck in space, and was the main anticipation from the first trailer, I wanted to know what will happen to him. But they spoiled it in the next trailer I was forced to watch. It was an ad on YouTube and showed that spoiler. So the next best thing was ""how do they survive?"" This is a story arc that has so much potential. Nebula could learn to trust people, or Tony's engineering could of been put to the test, but NO! Captian Marvel just flew up to the ship and saved them. Since I was anticipating so much for this, it left an unsatisfying feeling. So much for ""satisfying finale"" in the Critics Consensus. Also, look, Tony invented time travel out of the blue. How did he invent it? How does it work? Who cares?! Everything in the beginning is rushed and trash so far. Then a rat saved Ant-Man. All of the beginning is rushed. But him being saved by a rat could of silped under my radar this time, because he can't really have a story arc, or progress the plot in the quantum realm. But with all of this lazyness combian, who cares?! Then the most anticipated moment of them all, fighting Thanos. That was a big twistm and was a good one (in a story standpoint). Then there was the dramatic 5 ysars later. Pixar was known for showing, not telling. But clearly that wasn't the case. And it definitely affected most of it. I had no idea what to expect, and in a bad way. How are cities like? Did people get over their losses? Clearly, I had know idea. The 5 years later was a dramatic one, but it really didn't help the story. They could of put one year later, and then show the progress of the cities. Just. More. Lazynees. But after this point, I have to say, it was pretty good. Revisiting past movies was AWESOME. Fight sences were Marvel standards. And I would of said this made up for everything. But the ending isn't the best. The ""whatever it takes to deliver a satisfying finale"" in the critics consensus feel more of a lie. Tony dying and ""completing"" his story arc, didn't actually feel complete. He just died with a kid he never got to raise and wasn't satisfying at all. All the critical reviews are really true, and that's a problem.",CAST#PERFORMANCE,Negative

"As its title states, this movie represented the end of the MCU (at least, with the original Avengers), wrapping up things quite nicely while giving us a deeply emotional story. Yes, the movie was predictable, but that didn't stop me, as well as everyone else, apparently, from enjoying what it had to offer. I might add that there are some pretty cringe moments, like the Fortnite scene, but aside from that, it was able to show the effects that Thanos's snap in Infinity War has on the Avengers. We are taken through the lives of each and every Avenger, and we are finally able to see how they come back together and get past their problems to save the universe one last time.

"Infinity War did something that no Marvel Studios film had done before: the villain won. At the end of the film, Thanos dusted half the life in the universe. We were left on a somewhat unfulfilled note at the end of the movie, and that continues right into Endgame.The trailers and promotions for the film were deliberately vague, as it is difficult to talk about the core premise of the movie without spoiling it. Instead, I'd like to focus on the huge number of cameos and references this movie has. Almost every single MCU film gets at least a small nod here, which is to be expected for this big finale event. Everyone gets to have their moment (some more than others), and there is a healthy amount of fanservice, especially toward the third act.The first act of the movie is verrrrry slow. Perhaps we have been spoiled, having grown accustomed to a big action set piece within the first 20 minutes of a Marvel film. There is an action sequence, but it is very anticlimactic, and leaves you feeling much as you did at the end of Infinity War, but at the wrong time. It seems they were trying to slow-roll the feeling of hope throughout the movie, but I felt we spent too much time at the bottom of the ladder.There are many satisfying moments, and everyone is given their due by the end of it.",CAST#PERFORMANCE,Positive
I did not like them killing off Ironman and Black-widow.,CAST#PERFORMANCE,Negative
"Can I give six stars?!?!?  Simply incredible- creative storylines and unexpected endings. Normally Tom Holland is the only one to kick ya in the feels (I normally say damn kid when referring to him, but in a good way).   EVERYONE brought their A+ game- those scenes with Renner and Johannson, RDJÂ’s solo moments, Hemsworth was just crazy funny. And that damn kid....  Even the sign off at the end., a well-deserved honor.      Well Done MCU",CAST#PERFORMANCE,Positive

happy sparkle. I love IRON MAN,CAST#PERFORMANCE,Positive
I like how it tied all of the Marvel movies in the infinity War series together and resolve half of the population being wiped out. I especially likes the little interview with Stanley that they showed after the credits finished,WRITING#PERFORMANCE,Positive
"Third time I watch it. By far the first time I saw it on opening day was the best experience. Because of all the hardcore fans around. But still, Thor's new persona makes the place laugh as does Hulk's new coolness. Great feel movie with a bit of sadness. Loved it.",CAST#PERFORMANCE,Positive
Enjoyed the movie.  Better than the last one.  A little disappointed in Thor. No info on Captain America when he stayed back in time.  Loved how Banner melded with Hulk.,CAST#PERFORMANCE,Positive
I had to see it twice before I actually liked it. There wasn't enough action and I was disappointed that Thanos was able to throw Captain Marvel around like a rag doll. Thought she was stronger. Overall it wasn't a bad movie but isn't in my top five of marvel movies.,CAST#PERFORMANCE,Negative
Good movie. Would see it again. I have to admit that I haven't had the chance to keep up with the series as I've been sick and unable to make it to the theaters. I had to wait to see Captain Marvel on Blue ray before I watched End Game at the theater. Now we need to go see Spiderman before it's gone from the theater.,CAST#PERFORMANCE,Positive
The only thing I didnt like was the fact that Iron man dies.,CAST#PERFORMANCE,Positive
"Love the action scenes, didnt like how Iron man came back right in the beginning. Didnt like how Thor was fat.",CAST#PERFORMANCE,Positive

"The overall movie was good for audiences that dont follow the comics of Marvel from the 70,s and 80,s Thanos Josh Brolin did a terrific job in intimating Thanos also the screen play didnt live up to the comics version overall it was an excellent movie but I think the directors should maybe consult with the real comic affaciandoes when doin such an touchy and sensitive subject. Thank u",CAST#PERFORMANCE,Positive
"Liked everything about it, sad to see Ironman gone",CAST#PERFORMANCE,Positive
Loved it except for some of the sad parts. Was worried about it being 3 hours but it didnt seem like it was. Great to see all of the marvel heroes together and see how stories were woven together. Loved the add on memorial to Stan Lee at the end.,WRITING#PERFORMANCE,Positive
I cried at the end of the movie....Exceptional Though....why did Tony Stark get a funeral and the other character that died didn't?,CAST#PERFORMANCE,Negative
Great movie but sure didn't want Ironman to die.,CAST#PERFORMANCE,Positive
Sad to see Tony Stark pass away.,CAST#PERFORMANCE,Negative
"The movie was great, a sad ending for Ironman.",CAST#PERFORMANCE,Positive
Absolutely amazing.  THE best super hero film ever made honestly.  Cap's ending was sad but poetic.  Not really happy what they did to Thor and the fact that we still haven't seen his true power in the movies.  But overall it was a near perfect film adaptation to a great comic story arc.,CAST#PERFORMANCE,Positive
"Great ending to the Marvel series. The action was spectacular with a good lead up to the end. Thanos proves no one can stop him taking down Thor, Captain America, Black Panther and Captain Marvel. However leave it to Tony Stark to save the day not using brute force but his wits.",CAST#PERFORMANCE,Positive
"Endgame is what we all needed after infinity war. Good acting, good action good, emotion good storyline and direction. It's an amazing ending to iron mans and caps story. And we all can't forget about Robert downy jrs performance. Endgame gets a 10/10",CAST#PERFORMANCE,Positive
"In the words of Tony Stark: Part of the Journey is the End. I Love You 3000. This was the final stretch of this 11 year pop culture phenomenon, and it was the most beautifully passionate of passion projects finished off with an ending you would happily shed a tear for.",CAST#PERFORMANCE,Positive
Excellent. Stan Lee's homage was pretty cool.,WRITING#PERFORMANCE,Positive
"I would have given a perfect score but I can't forgive what the writers and Ruffalo did to the Hulk. What a shame. Other than that I can think of about a dozen ""wow"" moments that audiences will find exceptional.",CAST#PERFORMANCE,Positive
"Could have showed more of the original Avengers and The Black Panther, Ant- Man and the Wasp.",CAST#PERFORMANCE,Neutral
Loved all The Avengers movies but hated to see Ironman (my favorite) die.,CAST#PERFORMANCE,Positive
Loved it and the Stan Memorial,WRITING#PERFORMANCE,Positive
I thought it was a good ending to the story.  I hated that Tony Stark died though.,CAST#PERFORMANCE,Positive
"I absolutely adore this movie and it is a true masterpiece of the comic book genre. This movie will have you on a roller-coaster of emotions. It will make you laugh, smile, cry, and jump out for joy overall. All of the actors bring it in this movie in particular Robert Downey Jr. He absolutely knocks it out of the park in this movie. The cgi and action scenes are top tier in this film. The 3 hour run time is perfect and it did not even feel like 3 hours at all and there is not a scene I would cut out of this movie. There are some plot holes in this movie, but with the use of time travel and reality changing in a movie it comes with it. This is a beautiful culmination of 11 years of building to get us to this point.",CAST#PERFORMANCE,Positive
"Meh. The whole time traveling to save the universe thing is a bit deus ex machina, but the battle scenes were awesome and Thor was the best.",CAST#PERFORMANCE,Positive
Great movie and great tribute to Stan Lee at the end,WRITING#PERFORMANCE,Positive
"Living long enough to see my childhood heroes come to life on the big screen is quite a dream come true. That said, the culmination of a decade of the MCU has spoiled me rotten. Endgame leaves me feeling a bit hollow. Yes, the opening act subverted our expectations in a fulfilling way, and the third act was epic on many levels. Watching Thanos punch that Captain Marvel wannabe in her smug gob with the power stone was particularly poetic. However, I feel the heavy-handed fan service was equally gob-walloping in retrospect. And I think the lazy writing engendered more questions for fans than it answered, as evidenced by the litany of post hoc explanations offered by the co-directors. In short, it lacked some of the intricacy and heart that made Infinity War so enthralling.",CAST#PERFORMANCE,Negative
Horrible way to end it. They should have ended at Infinity War. LetÂ’s face it was Thanos really the bad guy????,CAST#PERFORMANCE,Negative
"Seeing this opening weekend was perhaps the best cinematic experience of my life. Many of the main avenger's character arcs that have spanned for years come to a perfect conclusion that is epic, intense and incredibly emotional. The 3 hours fly by as comic book fans and casual viewers alike are on the edge of their seat wondering how this decade long saga will come to an end. The fact that these superhero characters in sci fi costumes have the ability to make so many grown men cry is a testament to the success marvel studios has had in bringing these characters to life. Robert Downey Jr., Scarlett Johanson, Chris Evans, Tom Holland, Gwyneth Paltrow, Jeremy Renner, Karen Gillian and Elizabeth Olsen stand out the most to me with their powerful and emotional performances.",CAST#PERFORMANCE,Positive
"Avengers: Endgame is the ultimate payoff for ten years of Marvel movies. Full of surprises, Endgame thrills with exhilarating action and tons of inside jokes for longtime MCU fans.Picking up from the end of Infinity War, Thanos has decimated half of all life in the universe with just a snap, and the world is left reeling from the catastrophic actions of the mad Titan. The Avengers mourn their fallen comrades and plot to recover the Infinity Gauntlet and its stones in order to reverse Thanos's damage.I really like the story. Endgame is just as much about the fight against Thanos as it is about the Avengers dealing with their own losses. This film sees our heroes at the lowest they've ever been. Watching each character deal with pain and grief says so much about who they are and how far they've come. My one gripe with the story is a plot element is introduced that makes the movie more complicated than it should be and leaves a lot of questions unanswered. But for the rest, Endgame has so many wonderful twists I wasn't expecting, and the more predictable plot points are executed in an entertaining way.Endgame doesn't drag for a second. The film is fast-paced and its three-hour running time flies by. Endgame ties up all loose ends and didn't leave me wanting anymore than what I got. I really like the score by Alan Silvestri. Silvestri uses the rousing Avengers theme sparingly but masterfully. He also mixes in musical cues from scores in other Marvel films that really adds to the experience.The main flaw in this film is the tonal inconsistency. Endgame, for the most part, jumps between quips and drama really well, but, sometimes those tonal shifts feel less effortless than they're supposed to be. For all the build up to this movie, Endgame is a fantastic film and a brilliant conclusion to the Marvel saga. If you're just getting into the MCU, I don't recommend seeing this film, but if you're already a Marvel fan, you're going to have a blast. I give Avengers: Endgame an age rating of 11 to 18 for some sci-fi violence and quite a few scenes of peril. And I give it 4 out of 5 stars.Reviewed by Benjamin P., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic. For more reviews by youth, visit kidsfirst dot org.",CAST#PERFORMANCE,Positive
"It was an okay addition to the MCU but it fell short due to the numerous plotholes that come with the concept of time travel. The film also had some jokes that didn't land, most of which related to Thor and his weight gain as a result of his depression.",CAST#PERFORMANCE,Negative
"Amazing movie! Stayed to the end, and the tribute to Stan Lee was really cool! Cant wait for more Marvel movies!!!",WRITING#PERFORMANCE,Positive
"I always enjoyed the Marvel Universe especially the avengers. I thought the movie was very well thought out and planned well. The Avengers Endgame made for a good cap to the series. I liked the idea of the time travel using quantum physics, since that is my niche. I am particularly fond of the the Stan Lee tribute at the end.",WRITING#PERFORMANCE,Positive
I love it I wish I could have more time to go and see again. the only thing I didn't like was the death of Iron Man. but the movie was awesome.,CAST#PERFORMANCE,Positive
"I'm still pissed they killed off Widow! Also I know they made Captain Marvel after Endgame, but she was capable of so much more. While I enjoyed seeing characters that aren't normally in the same movie together, I felt like there were too many to really spend enough time with each.",CAST#PERFORMANCE,Positive
"I can't believe they killed Thanos like that. Thanos was just trying to live his life as a farmer, after dominating 50% of the population and Thor just came in and killed him. Unbelievable, I cried and I don't usually cry. This is making me emotional just typing this. Other than that, the game was epic and I cried at the end when iron man died.",CAST#PERFORMANCE,Positive
"Avengers: Endgame is a very fitting conclusion to Phase 1, 2 and 3 of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. But too much of the story happened off-screen, The effects and devastation after the snap, Hulk completing his entire character arc, Rocket becoming an avenger, Tony Stark marries Pepper Pots, Tony having his only child, Tony forgiving Steve, and multiple more.",CAST#PERFORMANCE,Negative
Excellent and great tribute to Stan Lee,WRITING#PERFORMANCE,Positive
loved how everything was tied together in the end. thank you Tony Stark,CAST#PERFORMANCE,Positive
"Endgame has it all, the PERFECT mix of humor, action and sadness along with amazing graphics and music, some of the things the MCU is getting extremely good at incorporating in their movies. The plot is near perfect too, and very unique, executed beautifully considering itÂ’s starting point after the events of Infinity War. And of course, seeing the finale to some of the best characters ever created, the ones weÂ’ve followed for the past decade and the past 22 movies, was heart wrenching and done so so well. I could easily talk for hours about all the amazing things about this movie, but thereÂ’s one more I want to mention: the iconic moments. *SPOILERS* Cap catching ThorÂ’s hammer. Â“On your left.Â” Â“I...am...Iron Man.Â” And the million other callbacks to the incredible universe Marvel has created, is just one of the reasons Endgame is a must see, and in my opinion, one of the greatest movies of all time.",CAST#PERFORMANCE,Positive
Loved it!! Lots of action and Stsn Lee!!,WRITING#PERFORMANCE,Positive
"You can not get any marvel movie that tops this. And it is Magnigicent herring it passes avatar. I loved the Funeral scene (Drax wears a shirt) and Tony's Sacrifice Scene. The funniest has got to be. ""I went for the head"" -Thor and that is my review",CAST#PERFORMANCE,Positive
"Avengers: Endgame is a 2019 American superhero film based on the Marvel Comics superhero team the Avengers. It is the sequel to 2012's The Avengers, 2015's Avengers: Age of Ultron, and 2018's Avengers: Infinity War, and directed by Anthony and Joe Russo,I was really looking forward to this movie, having rated the previous installment very highly. But this one fell flat for me. The first half is incredibly slow, with very little action and uninspired relationships between the characters. Overall this movie is far too long, and doesn't contain the humour, drama, or emotional elements of its predecessor.",DIRECTING#PERFORMANCE,Negative
"I think it's a liitle bit better than Infinity war beacuse the movie ends an 11 year universe with 21 movies.Also Infinity War it' a vilain movie Endgame it's a fantastic superheroe movie with a great end about Iron Man,Captain America and Black Widow.",CAST#PERFORMANCE,Positive
"I liked the whole story line, fight scenes, the part when Cap was worthy to care Mjolnir, one on one fight between the Cap and Thanos.",CAST#PERFORMANCE,Positive
It's got a real slow start but once it gets going it's pretty much not stop action. It had some highs and some serious lows. I personally didn't like the ending but did love the tribute to Stan after the credits.,WRITING#PERFORMANCE,Positive
"I can always do with fewer explosions and more witty banter but still a satisfying conclusion to this timeline. I watched it in ""re-release"" which included the charming tribute to Stan Lee - may he have a CGI cameo in every Marvel movie henceforth. It also included the DieHard ""outtake"" which I thought was hilarious though I was one of the few in the room who got it. When you're old, you get more jokes.",WRITING#PERFORMANCE,Positive
"Wow. Just wow. The Russos pulled it off. A funny, epic and most importantly emotional conclusion to the infinity saga. The acting is amazing, especially from Robert Downey Jr, who should get an Oscar for his performance. The way it pays of a lot of things and character arcs from all the other 21 movies is truly incredible. Must-watch.",DIRECTING#PERFORMANCE,Positive
Slow beginning.  Like what they did with the Hulk!  Action towards the end was great but felt like there could have been just a tad bit more of a story line.  Felt just a little short and if they had made it even longer to include this I still would have watched the whole thing!   Just felt a little something was missing.,CAST#PERFORMANCE,Positive
"The Russo brothers did it again! Growing up with these films has been incredible. Although I make a habit of scrutinizing Marvel films, I know they'll never be doomed because of Kevin Feige at the helm. Legendary.",DIRECTING#PERFORMANCE,Positive
Great movie but Captain Marvel was the biggest let down,CAST#PERFORMANCE,Negative
Loved the movie but I was sad when Natasha and Tony died and was also sad when Peter Parker cried. But I didnÂ’t like ThorÂ’s beer belly.,CAST#PERFORMANCE,Positive
Didnt like that Tony Stark/Ironman died and that Thor was portrayed as a fat drunk.,CAST#PERFORMANCE,Negative
"It was nice in that it concluded a decade of Marvel story-lines with gravity and emotion.  However, it drags at the beginning which makes it hard to rewatch. Further, the time-travel component opens up many plot holes that aren't adequately addressed.  Finally, and most egregiously, several moments in the film are so silly that they break the immersion and emotional connection fostered in this and previous films: fat Thor, that girl-power moment, and Thanos' copter-sword among them.",CAST#PERFORMANCE,Negative
"Did not like the way Hulk was permanently transformed.  Ant man character was a little disappointing.  Did not like that Ironman died and Captain America decided to remain old.  Seemed a little more goofy than previous Avengers.   Altogether, however, well done.  Clever ideas for the most part.",CAST#PERFORMANCE,Positive
"As an ending of this glorious saga, it did well. However, for someone like me who isn't as invested in Marvel movies, I didn't fully understand certain things like the stone functions or... quantum physics (there, I said it!) When it comes to superheroes, I suppose I'm a big fan of films like the Guardians of the Galaxy movies which don't have a bunch of tension and suspenseful music, but humor and feel-good music. This movie was a little bleak overall because it does take place after the snap, but it was still enjoyable with many scenes. Being a GOTG fan, of course I enjoyed Rocket belittling Ant-Man to a small puppy and Starlord dancing to ""Come and Get Your Love"", a flashback to the first film. Anyways, I'm looking forward to Phase 4, as there will be many new films adapted from characters who haven't gotten as much love as stuff like Iron Man, Spider-Man, and so on.",CAST#PERFORMANCE,Neutral
A breathtaking Cinematic Experience which does justice to all of it's stars as well as being a perfect sendoff for the characters of Tony Stark and Natasha Romanoff.,CAST#PERFORMANCE,Positive
"Tony Stark was able to build this in a cave! With a box of scraps!Tony Stark research a new element with a pipes!Tony Stark create a nano-tech costume with nothing!END GAME : Hold my beerTony Stark create a time-machine for a 5 minutes!yep movie not bad, but time trawels e.t.c so fucking bad idea.",CAST#PERFORMANCE,Negative
"Ultimately unsatisfying end to a huge story told over multiple movies. The Hulk had always been one of my favorite parts of each movie he appeared in, he was perhaps my least favorite part of this one. How they chose to handle his character was frustrating and annoying. I really wish Thanos looked more like he does in the comic (Thanos Imperative to be specific) and less humanlike. They made his armor safe and boring but his human eyes bothered me the most. A lot of the humor fell flat and where you could tell people where supposed to laugh, the theatre was silent. There was so much build up for Captain Marvel and she barely appeared or played much of a role in the story line. Fat Thor was just underwhelming. I don't understand the decisions they made on this one and am pretty disappointed. When something builds as much as this whole Phase 1-3 did, it's a difficult task to wrap it up.",CAST#PERFORMANCE,Negative
"I watched this film on opening weekend and enjoyed it. Even though the film is three hours long, every moment is one to be treasured because this is the last film for many of the actors that have been on the big screen for the last 11 years, especially for Robert Downey Jr. and Chris Evans. The Russo brothers did not disappoint.",PERFOMANCE#GENERAL,Positive

"Greatest movie of all time!! ????I've never been more excited and emotional watching any other movie. This movie gave me what I wanted and more. So funny, so exciting, never boring for a single second, has the most electrifying scenes of all time (we all know those parts??...the assembling, Iron Man's last words to Thanos, Captain America's worthy moment, and so many others...). Also has the best tear rolling scenes (not that I cried...I wanted to, but I couldn't), the deaths, the goodbyes, the big six credits...etc.My problem with the movie is that Iron Man didn't shine and Thor also didn't shine, you know, like captain Marvel, Captain America, Scarlet witch...but still, the writers, directors, and especially the actors did a perfect job.Seeing endgame was my movie-watching destiny. So glad the movie made it destiny very satisfactorily fulfilled.",CAST#PERFORMANCE,Positive
"I loved this movie. I think its the best movie in Cinematic history. Clearly the best MCU movie. About the movie. A culmination of 21 movies going back 11 years. Staring pretty much everyone. The best actors of our generation. Thanos the evil Mad-titan obsessed with collecting all Infinity stones: Soul Stone, Power Stone, Time Stone, Space Stone, Reality Stone and Mind Stone. Thanos defeated our heroes, wiped out half of all life in the universe and escaped. This movie is about the result of that defeat and how our heroes will respond. Why the movie is great: The reason this movie is great is because it's the pinnacle on top of all the other movies in the MCU. It takes clues, places people and stories from all the other movies. You get to see the real human toll on the characters from their defeat. The defeat really wounded them and you get to see that. This makes the film more emotional, real and not disposable. The three act break down like this - First Act - The aftermath of Infinity War, Act 2 - Time Heist, and Act 3. Final Battle.The movie is interesting, mind bending, nostalgic, smart, funny, emotional, entertaining, at times violent, epic and in the end the most satisfy conclusion you could possible get from a movie experience.Watch this movie and you will realized you watched something that will never be replicated again. Maybe not even by the MCU. This not even Movie Magic - it's Movie Sorcery. What Marvel crafted here is nothing short of amazing.It's a movie anyone can enjoy. No matter who you are or where you are. Young, Middle aged, old. Every denomination.If you watch this movie be prepared to cry. Don't bring tissues, bring a towel, a beach towel.",CAST#PERFORMANCE,Positive
"An emotional roller coaster with spectacular acting, outstanding writing, genius directing and impressive CGI. Avengers: Endgame is a must see, and it's almost flawless. The only flaws (Thor's writing and Captain Marvel) will be fixed in the future, undoubtedly.",CAST#PERFORMANCE,Positive
"Hard to rate, a 5 star right up until what happens with Captain America.  A real big turn off, at the end all I am thinking is ""why did they do that???""   So I knocked it 2.5 stars due to that alone.",CAST#PERFORMANCE,Negative
"Just a Light show of colors flying all over the screen! You call this a movie? There's not even any new characters!

"The buildup of 21 movies was honestly great but this movie was an honest let down. Paying more to fan service than something that could've made this the greatest movie in cinema with barley to none problems. But I had enormous problems with this movie. Captain Marvel seems to be cocky, Hulk becomes smart with only dialogue to explain it then to show it, and Captain America wielding Mjollnir was out of nowhere with no explanation what so ever (which I know fans were mad about in Age of Ultron since he made it bump a little). I think Captain Marvel should've been given more screen time and a great arch (I honestly don't like her; please fix Marvel). Hulk should've been shown to have been experimenting with Thanos' Gauntlet to resize the stones to snap everyone back but this backfires with him being stuck in the Hulk's body. And Captain America could've tried to catch the hammer but Thor screamed at him not to. But it lands in his hand and he looks to Thor in shockHonestly this movie could've used more work before being released",CAST#PERFORMANCE,Negative
An outstanding finale for the Infinity Saga.The MCU started with the hammering sound of Iron Man.And Endgame ended with that legendary sound.,CAST#PERFORMANCE,Positive
"Avengers: Endgame has got to be one of the worst movies that I have ever seen.  Three hours of my life flushed down the toilet. First of all, for a three hour movie, nothing happens for the first hour as we get to see all the remaining Avengers wallow in their self-pity for not having defeated Thanos in the prior film.  Once the Avengers have formulated their plan to go back in time, the plot is disjointed and moves between various characters in a haphazard incoherent fashion.  Of course, after three hours, we finally get to see the big battle between all the Avengers and Thanos and his army.  The battle scene is laughable with all super heros getting screen time to show how inept they are at defeating Thanos.  The battle scene reminds me of the battle scene from South Park's Imagination Land.   The movie is tedious and incredibly boring. The only entertaining aspect of this movie is watching fat drunk Thor.  If you really want to watch entertaining mindless drivel, watch The Bacherlorette or Naked and Afraid.",CAST#PERFORMANCE,Negative
"Though not perfect, the epic journey which started over 10 years ago with Iron Man comes to a satisfying crescendo. You will be hard pressed to find such cathartic moments than the ones in Endgame where Marvel pays off multi-year story lines, and character arcs. Those that invested time into the MCU over the past decade will be rewarded. Avengers, assemble!",CAST#PERFORMANCE,Positive
"To be honest, I was feeling some serious Marvel fatigue the last two years. That is until Infinity war hit theatres. That film felt fresh again and reinvigorated my interest in the franchise. Unfortunately Endgame shot it right down again. Time travel really was the most predictable and worst choice the could have made. The comics have always had the problem that nobody stays dead, and if it weren't for the fact that actors age or move on this solution would have opened the same can of worms for the MCU. Still it does rob the deaths in Infinity war from much of their gravitas, which left me rooting for Thanos to pull it of again, perhaps this time killing exactly the other  half. Perhaps this is why they made Thanos feel more like a one-dimensional villain than in Infinity war. It isn't a bad film by any stretch of the imagination but for me atleast it lacks any real emotional impact and madr me wish they had stopped at Infinity War.",CAST#PERFORMANCE,Negative

"It's awesome! It is the crescendo to the MCU (so far) that all the fans have been waiting for, and it delivers marvellously. Some of the best moments in all of the Marvel films to date are in this movie, and it pays off some things it's been setting up for years in such a satisfying way that I left the theatre feeling full. Unfortunately, some of the characters' stories get short shrift, some of the pacing wasn't great, and Carol Danvers was intolerable in the few scenes she was in. But over the course of 3 hours this film's weaknesses are far overshadowed by it's towering successes.Closest comparison: It's been a good run.

"Most fans expected that ""Avengers: Endgame"" will resort to time travel to make everything right. It is the same idea of ""X-Men: Days of Future Past"".Three moments made ""Avengers: Endgame"" terrific but not a masterpiece, the 1st one is killing Thanos by Thor at the beginning, 2nd one is the sacrifice of Black Widow, and the last one is the death of Iron Man, actually these three unexpected moments shocked all Avengers fans.I have also some negative comments starting with the purpose of Captain Marvel in Endgame!! Actually the only role for her is saving Iron man from a lonely death in space!! The other thing is the final battle, in my humble opinion, it was chaotic as same as White Walker battle in Game of Thrones, also the time travel was a bit hasty and unconvinced, especially in the way of retrieving the infinity stones.Anyway, ""Avengers: Endgame"" is the final movie in the Avengers series, and its ending is a good way to say goodbye.",CAST#PERFORMANCE,Positive

"Infinity War was clever. Endgame is just silly. You could write a novel about all that is wrong with it, but let's mention the most glaring examples:1. Time travel. Never use it as a plot device. It becomes dumb,  and removes any sense of consequence. It is basically a reset button. And Endgame takes the price for amount of self contradictions when clumsily making use of it.2. Thanos was an interesting character in IW; here he is just a cartoon villan.3. Everything with Thor. Ragnarok identified him as a true god of thunder; the hammer was just to focus his powers. And now suddenly Steve Rogers can call lightning?4. Political correctness. Cap's main motivation for several movies has been his old pal Bucky, but now at the end it's suddenly black wing guy who gets the final moments with him and takes over the shield? I guarantee that was NOT the original plan. There's lots of PC in the movie, but this is the most glaring example. Another grating example is the whole presence of Captain Marvel; over-powerful, and yet useless.5. Humor. In IW it was clever. Here it is mostly reduced to fart jokes.6. Don't just copy yourself, Russos. The soulstone sacrifice in IW was moving. Here I could not give a shit.7. Thanos, again. In IW a handful of Avengers almost defeated him when he had the glove and most of the stones; they only failed because of the emotional stakes (again, clever). Thor bested him after he got the whole thing. And in Endgame the whole lot of them, including supergirl cannot get in a good punch when his only weapon is a big axe?There's tons more, but I'll pause at that. Final thoughts:Infinity War was clever and more importantly full of tension, from the very first scene. Endgame was boring, and more that a little annoying. I found myself distracted by my phone whilst watching it, which only happens with really bad movies. What bothers me the most is that is makes a mockery of all the ground work laid down by the best of the Marvel movies; Winter Soldier, Ragnarok, Civil war, Infinity War.It is comparable to Alien 3 after Aliens - there are good moments but you mostly want to un-see it.",CAST#PERFORMANCE,Negative
"When I saw Infinity War, I enjoyed it, but still thought it wasn't just as good as Avengers Assemble and Age of Ultron (unpopular opinion, but I love Age of Ultron more than Assemble.) But when I watched Endgame in the cinema, I knew Marvel had made a far better film than the other 3. It was funny, action packed and emotional, and finally gave Tony Stark a redemptive arch which he slightly gained in the original Iron Man movie. The cast is superb, the effects groundbreaking and, hear me, I felt Marvel has raised a bar it cannot beat. Overall, an EPIC movie.",CAST#PERFORMANCE,Positive
Great movie! Only drawback was Brie Larson's complete inability to emote. It's a shame they didn't recast Captain Marvel for this film but that is a minor gripe about a great movie.,CAST#PERFORMANCE,Positive
"After the tragic and devastating ending of Infinity War, when Thanos wiped out half of all life in the universe with a simple snap of his fingers. Now, the remaining Avengers have to find a way to reverse his actions and bring hope to the universe once again. The Russo Brothers direction is a solid as Winter Soldier, Civil War and Infinity War. I would go so far to say this is the best film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The cast was perfect and are on their A-game with best of them being both Robert Downey Jr. and Chris Evans as Iron Man and Captain America. The film focuses more on emotional depth and character development more than action like in Infinity War and it works so well. Marvel have made a masterpiece and possibly the best superhero movie ever made! This a film that keep you on the edge of your seat all the way to the end of the final battle that's as epic as the one in Return of the King. I'm gonna give Avengers: Endgame an A+",CAST#PERFORMANCE,Positive

It was good but it could've been better... I wanted the Hulk to come back and fight Thanos part 2 they made Captain Marvel stronger than Thor...which is nowhere near true... I believe Thanos shouldn't have been beaten so easily but fight scenes were great story was great the Thor comedic scenes were funny lol and captain America using Thor's hammer shocked me and iron man dying was bitter sweet.

"Meh. Bloated runtime, plot holes you could drive a Buick through, and the worst acting by Ruffalo yet (how does someone actually get worse at their job, rather than better!?). The ending feels rushed after so much unnecessary filler; and the heartbreak at the end doesn't receive nearly the gravitas it should. The best scene of the film, where the women come together (because, let's face it, women just don't DO that), lasts all of 30 seconds. A million different ways they could have gone with it, and it would have been a better story; but I guess the age of lazy, over-the-top special effects has completely killed the age of the storyteller. By all means, waste your three hours to watch and get some (?) closure for the universe we've invested so many years in; but when you're done, go find a GOOD film to watch.",CAST#PERFORMANCE,Negative

"It was an amazing movie. I cried more times then I'd like to admit though. Even though I rate this five stars, there are some things I disagree with. Captain America's ending was bullshit. He spent pretty much all three of his movies trying to get Bucky back and as soon as he saw a woman he'd known for a couple of years and suddenly he doesn't care anymore. Peggy Carter had a whole family, Steve even KISSED HER NEICE. The reason I'm giving it five stars is because of the impeccable acting done by all of the actors in the movie, but mainly Robert aswell. I have never been able to see so much emotion in an actors eyes while they are acting like that (except Sebastian Stan comes very close). That's my opinion, that's only what I think so please don't get offended. Sincerely, a girl who needs to go to sleep.",CAST#PERFORMANCE,Positive
"Overall, good, and it had to end eventually.Assorted bad and mean jokes at the expense of Thor, who anyone with more than 2 functioning brain cells and any sense of decency would be able to tell is dealing with horrible PTSD from the lose of his planet, family, friends, etc.Horrible cuts that seem to have female starts teleporting from where they were just shown (and back afterwards) to show off ""Girl Power"" strutting across the battlefield.Seriously, Scarlet Witch is Bad Ass, Okoye (Wakandun General) and Black Widow are both nearly superhero level because of skills and tech.Why the F does I-Want-Your-Manager hair cut get so defended and plopped center stage?  She is horrible.Does she have dirt on Samuel L or something?WTF Cpt.

"Complete trash. Maudling, boring, feminist themed crap. Crapton Plankface killed the mood every time she showed up on screen with her entitled displeased soccer mom expression (the only one she has). Thanos really did kill the avengers and this is proof.",CAST#PERFORMANCE,Negative
Why did they have to mess with plotline of the entire MCU by time traveling? They do not understand the major ramifications of time travel and tampering with the natural course of time. And before you say that they did that in doctor strange; you need to know what happens if you alter time to suit your own ends. Look at Flashpoint and how it made Barry Allen realize the consequences of what happens when he goes back in time and saves his own mother. But in this movie they wielded time travel like a kid who received ray gun for Christmas.,CAST#PERFORMANCE,Negative

"Genial forma de terminar la saga del infinito. Cierto es que se recurren a recursos simples, como el viaje temporal, y la trama a veces hace un poco agua, pero al menos los Russo consiguen contarlo de una forma emotiva, que nos permite entendernos e identificarnos con los personajes.Una pelÃ­cula mÃ¡s que satisfactoria, y todo un ejemplo de como crear una saga que se va expandiendo a lo largo de decenas de pelÃ­culas",DIRECTING#PERFORMANCE,Negative

"Okay, I thought they'd have trouble topping Infinity War. I thought Infinity War was too ambitious and it was a miracle that it was as good as it was. But no, the cast, crew, and producers of the MCU have proved time and time again their talent.  While Infinity War was more action packed, and was really Thanos' movie. Endgame is the Avenger's movie, and focuses for the most part on character. Each and every character dealing with the grief of who they've lost. We see some of our favorite heroes at their absolute lowest. But, like heroes do, when there's even a little bit of hope, they gotta take it, whatever it takes.  Now being what the MCU's been leading to the past decade, you really need to have been watching these movies as they were coming out to really understand it all. That being said, if you're like me and you've been keeping with these movies as they came out, you'll definitely enjoy all the callbacks to previous films.I enjoyed this one scene, if you're caught up with the comics, there was this controversial Captain America comic a few years back, the movie had a short scene referencing it and I couldn't stop grinning.  Now it wouldn't be a superhero movie without any action, and the final battle of this movie is by-far the biggest final battle I've ever seen. It didn't have a single dull moment.  Overall, this is the film they've been leading too ever since the first Iron Man movie came out back in 2008, and it's been quite a ride, and one hell of a finish",CAST#PERFORMANCE,Positive
"I have a very unpopular opinion on this film. I thought it was a great movie...I thought it was overrated and the writers made a lot of poor decisions. (Spoilers Ahead)First off, the argument between Black Widow and Hawkeye was a bit silly. Everyone was expecting Hawkeye to sacrifice himself and he was the most likely to do so. He hasn't done much in the MCU and Black Widow has a big fan following and many fans really care about her. Also, Black Widow would have an awesome film career vs making prequels about her and not having the fans care as much as if she was still alive. Also if Hawkeye had died, his daughter -who we saw shooting a bow and arrow in the first few minutes of the movie- could assume the role of Hawkeye or Ronin. I feel that fans would appreciate that more than having an irrelevant avenger sitting around. Second, in Endgame they completely devalued Thor and Hulk. They build these characters up throughout many films and then they threw it all away for the big finale of the movie which did not please me or many other fans.Last, Endgame should have been split into two movies. They could have shown the impact of having half of the population snapped away and not have that responsibility fall into other MCU films like Spider-Man: Far From Home. That also could have given us more character development and reasoning for all of the big changes that happened between all of the avengers.",CAST#PERFORMANCE,Negative
This movie was way too slow and too long. I don't mind a movie that is slow if it has great dialogue and characters. But I'm not a huge fan of most of the superheroes in Avengers. I think to enjoy this movie you need to be deeply invested in all of them. The only interest I had was with Thanos. The problem is the Thanos we seen for most of this movie had very little knowledge of all the superheroes he was fighting. He obviously had no knowledge of what happened in Infinity Wars. So the fight scenes didn't have as much weight to them as they should have. This was the biggest problem I had with them using time travel. Also time travel has been done so many times it just felt cheap and lazy. I'm also not a fan of them making Thor fat and making Hulk more human like. They are trying to get rid of all the best male superheroes. They also killed off Iron Man. They are full on SJW's putting down male characters and trying to make the female ones look better. I can't stand this trend with Marvel. You also get a scene with all the women superheroes on screen at once. It's too in your face at this point for me. I like strong female leads like Wonder Woman if done right. But Marvel goes about it the wrong way. The ending had some cool action scenes with some cool CGI. But that doesn't make a movie good. It's something that can help compliment a movie if everything else is good. But this movie was terrible in my opinion.,CAST#PERFORMANCE,Negative

I did not anticipate crying in an action film but I am glad that this was not just a one note action packed sensory overload film.

"What can you say? A finale containing epic imagery and excellent acting (especially on Robert Downey Jr.'s part) that never lets up even for a second.

Definitely worth your time if you've invested everything into this franchise, like I have.",CAST#PERFORMANCE,Positive
It was a greatest hits movie and it was good but didnÂ’t really add something different. Infinity war felt a bit better and this was the runner up for me. The thing that really gets me is killing IronMan. They can say all they want about his sacrifice and what not but they should have used Captain not Tony. Tony was too good of a character to let go like that. Evens wanted to go and that would have made more sense than having Tony go.,CAST#PERFORMANCE,Negative

"I LOVED infinity war. One of the best superhero movies I have ever seen... Endgame on the other hand, decided to dive headfirst into fan service. There was enough here to enjoy (especially a certain weapon wielding moment of joy) but it felt more like a 'best of' compilation then a well-structured standalone outing. (SPOILERS FROM HERE....) The first act was gloriously good, the fallout from the previous film really hammered home and built on. Then the hulk was introduced... And my goodness I was dissappointed with bruce banner's character arc being ended OFF SCREEN. Him and Natalia had basically zero interaction, and he was used largely as a joke machine. Thor also (although hilarious) was almost completely comedic. He met his own dead mother and told jokes every single second he was with her... No raw tender moment there. Endgame felt much more of a popcorn turn-your-brain-off film than Infinity war (which wasn't exactly the imitation game either). It must have been tremendously hard balancing this film and the main retiring players (Cap, Iron Man) got their dues, black widow and hawkeye's mission for the soul stone just rehashed Gamora's death but with less impact which was a bit of a lame way to go about it, and the whole 2nd act was just referencing and replaying scenes from the previous marvel films with different outcomes. It felt like a youtube comments section or a 'How it should have ended' video had been inserted into an avengers film, which really felt unnecessary. (why did cap need to fight cap? Why does Bruce's professor hulk act so... Dumb?) A lot of these moments felt forced and unnecessary, with a levity that just didn't quite suit all the build up. All in all I came out of the theatre and said I thought the film was average... My girlfriend responded that I was mental and it was fantastic. It's the same response I see everywhere, and I am  happy so many enjoyed it, but sad that I cannot share the sentiment. It's just not as good as it promised to be. Infinity war for me will suffice as a brutal but glorious pinnacle of the marvel universe.",CAST#PERFORMANCE,Negative

"As is typical for Marvel Movies, the special effects were stunning. No one can argue that indisputable fact. The story itself was pretty lackluster, treating the old guard with rather scathing disrespect, and entirely removing several others (Which one got me the most may surprise you). it was good for a few laughs, but ultimately, I was largely underwhelmed. This was supposed to be the biggest, most spectacular, most moving movie in the MCU, and I left the theater rather disappointed.Where Infinity War was able to juggle their massive cast of characters with relative ease, Endgame haphazardly fumbles with nearly half as many characters over a longer slower movie. Several character arcs are cut short, perhaps to save room for additional sequels, while others are cut entirely. I thought the treatment of our beloved green giant was humorous at first, but when I realized that he was written out of the script entirely, I was livid. Thor's character arc was solid, but perhaps at the expense of his overarching character. Where it makes sense for the context of the Avengers movies, it is entirely baffling that so much of his character growth from his own movies was sacrificed. Character regression is fine, and actually commonplace, but when the resolution is unfulfilling, the entire duration of their screen time feels like a waste.Others have noted that certain minority and female roles have been relegated to the back burners, but I feel the same could be said about most of the characters. After having seen Black Widow and Nebula's character arcs and Scarlet Witch's resolved story line from Infinity War, I could hardly see how we had seen the same movie, but characters like Captain Marvel, Shuri, and War Machine did seem to have minor roles, for what it is worth,",CAST#PERFORMANCE,Negative
"It's long but I never felt in the 3 hours that my time was being wasted. There's a little less comedy injected into the film that usual but it's still there. But what we're all here to see - the remaining Avengers plotting against Thanos and ""avenging"" his crimes against the universe, is captured rather well despite the outcome being somewhat predictable considering Marvel didn't do as good of a job hiding future movies from leaking to the public. Yes, despite that the events that occur still feel fresh and almost unpredictable and the movie really flares up as the 3 hour mark draws nearer, meaning don't bail if you're a little uninterested in the first hour because it gets really, really good. What's always been amazing is how well Marvel movies can use so many characters effectively with big backgrounds and big personalities but never feel like it's leaving anyone out. Give how many members there are of these Avengers that's a pretty incredible feat. I don't think I'd call Endgame a perfect conclusion to what we know of as the 3rd wave which started with Captain America Civil War (ends with Endgame) but it's pretty close. The movie did something that Star Wars 1-3 failed to do: deliver in the midst of great expectations and familiarity with where things are going and I love that.",CAST#PERFORMANCE,Positive
"Saw it with my son who did like it, but I thought this was one of the most boring movies of the year. I did not laugh about the (intended) jokes and I was absolutely not dragged into the story. Until the end I did not care if the Avengers would win or not. The only highlights in the movie were the amazing special effects, especially making Michael Douglas look 50 years younger. The movie theater was filled with children around my son's age (11) and that is probably the target audience.",CAST#PERFORMANCE,Negative
"As Stan Lee died in 2018 and this came out in 2019 and he always liked to appear in a cameo in his films like Alfred Hitchcock, this time they either dug him up or had a look-alike.

Pointed at the enemy was she able to blast them into the past? As for Thanos's sidekick: my mate's got no nose... how does he smell...terrible!",PERFOMANCE#GENERAL,Negative
"As far as super hero movies goes, this is as pretty much as good as it gets. That said, it is not as good as Thor Ragnarok. I was already tired of Thanos, and there is more of him.

While staying within these boundaries, Endgame does deliver a very solid and entertaining no brainer.",CAST#PERFORMANCE,Positive
"Nice ending to the saga. It was a long movie so I'm glad I waited until I could rent it to be able to pause it for a break. Sad to see Iron Man is gone. Quite a significant impact from Ant-Man which was a bit of a surprise. It's a shame Thor is not his usual self. I expected a bigger impact from Captain Marvel, but she did destroy the massive enemy space ship which was a huge moment in the final battle.

"Avengers: endgame, produce by Antony and Joe Russo, in my opinion is one of the best movies of this sequel, I really like the way that the characters performed, the story was really great, it fits so perfect with all of the previous movies, but in here there's a problem, if you haven't watch the previous movies you get lost on this one. Another thing that I really liked is the visual effects, I've always wondered how they do it, how can they work so perfectly on the effects that they add in this movie and in all of the previous ones, for me the visual effects are a really important aspect because with a lack of them, especially on this type of movies, the movie won't have a realistic look, they help to achieve what is practically impossible in real life depending on each movie. Another favorite thing of mine about this movie was Peter Parker, his performance on this movie was excellent.

"Avengers Endgame is a fantastic american super hero movie based on the marvel comics. The writters have done an excelent job because they managed to connect and conclude the incredible saga in 21 movies. The film was directed by Anthony and joe Russo and it was starred by many actors from previus films in the marvel cinematic universe. Such a Robert Downey Jr, Chris Evans, Scharlet Johanson, Chris Hemswoth.I think that development of the movie is great because it develops in many planets in the universe and that give it a big reach. The story of the film is fantastic because it was planned 10 years ago with the premiere of iron man in 2008 and in 21 movies in the marvel cinematic universe.Each one of this 21 movies has relevance to the story with the culmination in Avengers Endgame; characters like iron man, hulk, captain america, thor, spider man awere building this great and fantastic universe.In the film each superhero gets their moment to shine. The visual effects are amazing epecially in the final battle sequence, capturing the massive scope of the battle and the multiple fights going on between the characters.Endgame is one of the best movies in the history because it doesnÂ´t have a happy end like in all the movies, however when you finish to watch you are really happy and satisfied with the resut because the cycle of many characters that appears 10 years ago is over and avengers endgame is just that is a new beginning for the new super heros in the marvel cinematic universe.The movie recived praise for itÂ´s incredible acting, music, direction, special effects and emotional weight; it beat the record at the box office colecting around 2,790 million dollars in the world making it in the most fundraising movie in the history.Still, there are some pacing issues and more than a few plot contrivances however Avenger Engame is a excelent movie and excelent conclution for this incredible saga.",PERFOMANCE#GENERAL,Positive
"For me this is the best Marvel movie of all times, I had been growing up with these movies and these characters, and it's amazing to see the development of the characters over the years, I mean at the beginning we met hulk and he used to be a beast that destroys everything around him and in this final movie heÂ´s one with his human side.On the other hand, the directors made an amazing job directing this movie. The Russo brothers are a couple of masters, everything is calculated and the way that they develop the story and the final battle it`s just incredible, I just cried in the cinema like a child, and the actors are just insane, the performance of Robert Downey Jr. itÂ´s perfect the way that his history ends with the words ""I`m iron man"".  It ends like it starts. Another thing that I really liked itÂ´s the performance of Josh Brolin as Thanos, OMG, itÂ´s just insane, he is in another league, he`s the best villain of all the MCU.In my own opinion this movie deserves at least an Oscar, it could be for the performance of the actors, or the CGI, itÂ´s sooooo good. In conclusion the final battle always going to be in my heart, I just went bananas when the cap was in front of Thanos and his army, and suddenly falcon told him "" On your left"" and the portals just started to appear, it was the best moment of all the superheroes movies of all times.From my point of view everybody should watch it. ItÂ´s a master piece and also it`s the culmination of 11 years of movies, 22 movies end with this final chapter.",PERFOMANCE#GENERAL,Positive

Thanos was brought from the past to the present and killed by Tony Stark with the snap of his fingers. This would had altered the present and erased the five years, his daughter.

"Pretty good, not the best Avengers movie in the series, but it did keep my interest.  Sorry to see Iron Man go - he had the best sense of humor of them all.   I used to read these comics when I was little - I didn't like Capt. Marvel then and I don't like it now.  Beside I remember Capt. Marvel as a male (Shazam).  She just seems totally out of place.  Sorry also that they made Thor look like a slob, it might have worked as a joke if they found him like that, but not for the whole movie.   Not a big fan of Guardian's of the Galaxy either so this movie was slightly disappointing.  I hope they somehow revive Iron Man and let him continue his adventures.",CAST#PERFORMANCE,Negative
"Avengers: Endgame was a disappointment for me. I don't even know where to start. The movie's pacing was horrible. It took forever for the plot to kick in. The Russo brothers completely butchered Hulk and Thor, especially the Hulk.I know they wanted to infuse Bruce Banner's intelligent mind in the Hulk's body for him to become Professor Hulk (like from the comics), but it was done SO HORRIBLY. The Hulk didn't even kill any enemy in the movie and barely fought. Hulk looked like Shrek in this movie. Hulk was SO CRINGE in this film. The worst depiction of the Hulk EVER!He looked so stupid and ugly. He was literally only there for helping with the time travel stuff and for comic relief. He didn't beat up nor kill any enemy nor yelled and smashed anything. He didn't even have his Hulk anger nor voice, he had Bruce's voice when he was the Hulk and seeing him wear glasses, talking with Banner's voice. I felt like we were robbed of a Hulk vs. Thanos rematch.The Russo brothers turned Thor into a stupid, comedic, fat drunk with an ugly beard. In one scene, Thor is a fat, lazy, immature alcoholic sitting down drinking lots of beer and playing Fortnite with Korg (who is atrociously voiced and portrayed by the overrated, severely miscast Taika Waititi) and some weird, little creature. Hulk tried to talk Thor into coming with him back to the Avengers and help them. Hulk soon convinces Thor by offering him loads of bottles of beer on the way to the Avengers facility. Thor looks kind of like an ugly hobo when he is fat and big-bearded.Hulk and Thor were forever ruined. They were depicted so atrociously that it wasn't even funny. That alone was enough for me to hate this film. Hulk and Thor are just jokes now. I will never forgive Disney, Kevin Feige, and the Russo brothers for completely butchering those two beloved characters.The time travel plot of the movie was so complicated, confusing, and made no sense. All of that time travel nonsense created so many countless, gigantic plot holes. The time travel was so senseless and illogical that it gave me a headache. The time travel scenes were extremely boring.Then when it finally came to the final battle in the third act, the part that took so long to finally happen, I was annoyed by that stupid, pointless WOKE scene where all the female characters (Iron Maiden, Wasp, Captain Marvel, Scarlet Witch, Shuri, Okoye, Nebula, Gamora, Mantis, and Valkyrie) randomly assemble together by themselves away from all the male characters. The one thing that really pissed me off about the third act was that Iron Man was killed off at the end! How could those idiot script writers kill him off?! Iron Man never got to confront and face his arch enemy, the Mandarin! That means no Iron Man 4!Oh and that ending with Steve Rogers time traveling back to the past to get rid of the Infinity Stones made no sense and left me feeling confused and scratching my head. So after he does that, he teleports back offscreen and Bucky and Sam see him sitting on a bench smiling as a wrinkly, gray-haired, senile 100-year-old man wearing a wedding ring. So when he went back in time to get rid of the Infinity Stones, did he get happily married and finally lose his virginity to Peggy (the woman of his dreams whom he fell in love with since World War II)? If so, won't that alter the future or something? Won't that mean he didn't get frozen and meet the Avengers and Sam Wilson? (I am deeply confused)Overall, Avengers: Endgame had a lot of good things going on in it, had great action scenes, and left quite an emotional impact, and was a somewhat epic swan song to the main Avengers franchise, but was ultimately confusing, horribly paced, poorly executed, inconsistent with its tone, filled with countless huge plot holes, had a bit too many jokes that derailed a lot of epic moments (what do you expect from a Disney Marvel movie?), disappointing, failed to deliver, failed to live up to expectations, and failed to live up to its huge hype. This movie could have been SO MUCH BETTER. I expected a lot better. There were still many missed opportunities and even unanswered questions.",PERFOMANCE#GENERAL,Negative
"As I don't go to theaters, just saw this on BluRay.  Meh.  Too many cameos (trying to get everyone in), a real slow beginning, not enough Brie Larson/Captain Marvel who didn't seem as important to plot as expected, ending was a hot mess that made little sense... glad to not waste money to see it.",CAST#PERFORMANCE,Negative
"Not a bad movie, some characters were mishandled and it was about an hour longer than it needed to be, there was a lot of edits that could and should have been made that were not.Tony Stark/Ironman was mishandled right off the bat when they basically had him give up on trying to get back home.Fat Thor was funny for a while, but should have ended when he armored up for the final fight.Captain America would never ""retire"" and quit being a hero, it's his inner character.The ""A Force"" scene was forced and you could almost feel everyone in the theater roll their eyes.I guess it was a decent end to the MCU.",CAST#PERFORMANCE,Negative
"It was alright. I don't get why everybody was raving about it. It doesn't make a lot of sense. The time-travelling part is so carefully studied and analyzed but only for the first half of the movie. Then things go downhill and the timeline is completely broken but no one seems to care -- Capitain America returns the stones on his own (supposedly right after they were picked up by everyone all over the galaxy at completely different times), Thanos dies twice, Nebula dies (!!!!) without affecting her future self, Gomorra is heavily briefed on her future (including her love story). Ugh... Sure the battle is epic but surely that's not ALL that matters, right? You gotta want things to make sense a little? *sigh*",CAST#PERFORMANCE,Negative
"""They're Hulk fans, they don't know Ant-Man. Nobody does.""After half the universe was wiped out by Thanos in Infinity War, Tony Stark makes it back to Earth after bumping into Captain Marvel in space and so the Avengers get together for one last battle with Thanos....Then the rest of the movie happens.Marvel put out an ad with the cast begging fans not to spoil this movie with the hashtag #dontspoiltheendgame.... so I won't. I wouldn't even try doing a review with spoilers til this movie hits blu-ray.So.... it's pretty goddamned hard to talk about this movie!So yeah if you don't want ANY spoilers, stop reading and see the movie, but I won't be giving away the gold here, I'm not an asshole.... unlike the commenters on EVERY single Youtube video, so don't watch Youtube til you see the movie either!Anyway...This was a pretty great comic book movie. Just when I thought Infinity War set a new bar for what's possible for visual effects and epic storytelling in comic book movies..... Endgame manages to take it to another level..... and I really mean that.I'd say probably the best thing about this movie is aside from maybe 2 or 3 out of a hundred moments in this movie..... I could not believe how surprising the story of this movie was. About 10 minutes in they do like 3 things that completely changed how I thought this movie was going to play out.And over the course of this 3 hour movie they followed every surprising turn with another. You normally find that level of surprise in truly original films, random example I had no clue where Whiplash was going. But I've never been so unable to predict the plot of a comic book movie before. It's nothing but left turns when normally a Marvel movie goes in a straight line.There's elements of time travel in this movie and what better way to add unpredictability to what is now the 22nd film in a series? I can almost see the writers going ""We're probably going to have to work in time travel to come up with more ideas.""The 2nd act of the movie... or 3rd act... kind of a 4 act movie.... but anyway the middle chunk of this movie is where the time travel materiel occurs and I was stunned at how much fun AND emotion they managed to get out of something that might sound like a cheat way to resolve the superbly dark ending of Infinity War. There's practically an entire film here just dealing with the time travel elements. You could almost make it the Thanos trilogy if you REALLY wanted.But they make it all work inside one film. 3 hours long and it feels like it, but not in a bad way. Nothing feels stretched out, 3 hours really is how long this movie NEEDS to tell this story. Matter of fact there's a shocking number of things that were NOT resolved that made me wish this movie was another half hour LONGER which I can't believe.The Russo brothers directing and Christopher Markus and Stephen McFreely writing.... this current era of the MCU might be over but I REALLY hope these 4 guys keep making Marvel movies because at this point I think they're the best at it. The fact that they were able to squeeze so much into these 2 Thanos movies without dropping the ball at any point is unreal. Joss Whedon couldn't even equal his own work when he did a second Avengers movie.The actors in this movie are all first-rate as per usual.Robert Downey Jr. continues his insane streak of performances since 2008 with Iron Man and continues to make Tony Stark one of the greatest comic to movie translations to date.Chris Evans, I thought Cap was shockingly absent from Infinity War, he had like 4 lines it felt like. Well now that Spidey, Doctor Strange and the Guardians of the Galaxy are all dead...... Cap gets some more screen time. And boy do they give Cap some standout moments, both action wise and dramatically. There's one action moment Cap gets that made my theater's audience lose their minds, it was the only moment like that in the movie. They laughed at all the jokes and so forth, the odd gasp here and there. But this one moment I'm talking about produced the loudest gasp I've ever heard watching movies my whole life. Captain America and Chris Evans knock it out of the park in Endgame.Chris Hemsworth, well.... I don't know what you THOUGHT they were gonna do with Thor in this movie now that he's back to being the all-powerful hammer-wielding God of Thunder..... but I sure as hell didn't expect what his role ended up being. Hemsworth is fantastic in the movie, keeping up his recent work evolving Thor into one of the more interesting Avengers. I will say.... I was genuinely weirded out by Thor in this movie.Cap, Iron Man and Thor have one fight scene together that really made me smile. I'm surprised it took so long to get that kind of fight scene from them.Josh Brolin, I won't give away Thanos' part to play in Endgame. But I will say it was possibly the most surprising thing in the movie for me. Like so surprising I almost stepped out of the movie for a moment because all I could think of was ""Jeez, that's smart..... dammit, I never would have thought of that!"" But suffice to say Thanos remains the best villain in the MCU.I'd be here all day listing every Avenger and their actor. I'll go quick here and say what you need to know about other actors in the cast. Jeremy Renner is great as Hawkeye. Mark Ruffalo is great as Hulk.... his part in the movie was spoiled by imagery I saw in line for POPCORN but that's another matter. Scarlett Johansson's great as Black Widow. Brie Larson is..... OK let me break off for a sec here.Boy did they waste a lot of time building up Captain Marvel lemme just say that. Because if you thought Captain Marvel was going to step in and save the day... like I was.... you're mistaken. All that build up for Captain Marvel and ESPECIALLY her role in this movie and I was stunned at how little screen time Brie Larson has. I figured this was gonna be her movie and... yeah it's really not. But Brie Larson's good in the movie with probably about 6 lines of dialog.And maybe not all that surprisingly Paul Rudd and Ant-Man steal a lot of the show in Endgame. I can't believe the amount of juice they managed to squeeze out of a character whose whole thing is shrinking and growing.There's.......... so much more to say...... like so..... so.... SO much more..... but you gotta see the movie before I could feel right getting into it. But it all has to do with that feeling of surprise I felt throughout the movie.So many times in this movie I thought ""Perfect.... that was perfect."" That's the bottom line with Avengers: Endgame.Not the end of the MCU of course.... how they can possibly... logistically top this movie I'm almost afraid to think about because.... I don't see it, frankly. If I owned Marvel I'd say, hit the ol' reboot button, recast, work in the X-Men and the Fantastic Four and let's start MCU 2. But.... I mean who am I kidding, they know what they're doing, obviously.I WISH TO HELL I could say I liked Endgame more than Infinity War... but I can't. Infinity War's the better movie, better story, I would say better action, better pacing, better ending.... that's the whole thing here, Infinity War was Empire Strikes Back and Endgame is Return of the Jedi. I love Jedi but.... it's no Empire now is it.Also one thing I loved about Infinity War was how big a role the Guardians of the Galaxy had, it was half their movie. Â And of course they're not in this movie besides Rocket and that's a little disappointing as a fan.Â But that doesn't take anything away from how ridiculously entertaining Endgame is. I have no doubt when we hit February 2020 and I'm going over what the best movies, scenes and performances of of 2019 were.... I'm going to be thinking of Avengers: Endgame an awful lot.The year is still young but I mean..... yeah.... Avengers: Endgame is my favorite movie of 2019 so far.",PERFOMANCE#GENERAL,Negative

"When I say that Avengers Engame is the most overrated movie of 2019, I mean that people and critics praised it more, the movie, yes, you could say that it is ""good"", but not so much for everyone to go crazy and say that it is the best superhero movie, a great example of how overrated it would be like, this movie was recently titled as the highest grossing movie in the history of cinema in general.Yes, if the film is very striking with its colors and all those characters, but simply what in Avengers Infinity War ""struggled"" to maintain the quality of the plot, here it simply does not matter, I just say that Captain Marvel suddenly find Tony and the other lady, they do not explain at any time how he did to find them, yes, if I know that the marvel lovers have already drawn their theories on that, to cover up the lazy mistakes of the writers. In Infinity War we saw the Thor plus Thor of the Thores, but now he is an obese alcoholic, the movie is not taken seriously sometimes, and that is a great example, or that Tony gets angry at first with Captain America because he does not It was there, blah, blah, blah, but if we use our brains, you will remember that in Infinity War he had the opportunity to call him and he did not, so I'm sorry Iron man lovers, but Tony had no right to get angry, and if we analyzed him well really Captain Marvel was a filler character, we all believed that this character would have great weight for the story but no, I thought that they did not try hard in their movie because they were going to want all this, but no, you can feel that the writers they didn't know what to do with it, and something they did go over with was the rat that accidentally released Ant-man, I'm just saying that you are more likely to see a cow flying outside your house to have that happen, which I leave wondering if the truck was closed, then how the fuck did that rat could get in?The time travel is very badly done, quantum physics clearly says that two equal objects cannot be together at the same time in the same place, so that fight of the American captains is impossible, and the rest is not even said , for example, Captain America in the end stays in the past meaning that The Avengers never had Captain America, which means that everything he did never happens, which leaves me wondering. Why did nothing change? Why is there no temporary paradox or any consequence for your decision? It's simple, the movie is so shameless in the sense that it doesn't care about those rules and does what it gives the gift wins. After that for no reason, Steve gives his position to Falcon because ............. in order to make a reference to the comics, he prefers to give his position to an African-American who he met recently Than your lifelong friend.Something that I honestly didn't understand, was how the gauntlet works, are you supposed to think about what you want and what happens? I don't know, I think, because Hulk throne his fingers and half of the universe that had disappeared comes back, but here goes the problem, if you think about it that is the worst thing he had to do, Thanos technically had already saved the universe by reducing the population , and that was something that the Avengers failed to understand, but that is the least, the problem is that being logical, of that half world literally literally, I wonder where the hell are all these people going to live? 5 years have passed and obviously their houses must already be inhabited by someone else, or their jobs, and logically they should have had an economic imbalance, but hey, the Avengers don't care about that and they are happy because they saved their friends, just I say his plan was very selfish.If you think about it really, the one who lost the most was Thanos, his goal was really not bad, that for starters, even in a part of the movie Steve tells Natasha something that the planet is less polluted Thanos was looking for his stones for a long time time and when he found the last one to get it he had to sacrifice his daughter, he also lost his friends, henchmen or not dry were, then after saving the universe, he just wanted to live in peace and eat his broth, but the Avengers do not arrive and they kill him, then they make a plan for all their sacrifices to go to waste, poor Thanos.To tell the truth that Hulk is now Hulk-Banner does not really bother me, what I would have liked is that they would have spent time on that, for example a movie of that would not be bad.But well now talk about how good this movie has, and I'd like to start with those little big details, which would be like Hulk uses a pencil to press the keys because his fingers are too big, or that Iron Man gives the hug to that Spiderman did not want to give him at Homecomeming, also that Bucky tells Steve that he is going to miss him although he is supposed to only leave for a few seconds, but it is because he knows him enough to know that Steve is going to live his life, and that that would be the last time he sees him young and for me that he is the best he would be being that in the final battle with Thanos, Thor every blow he hits is directed at Thanos's head.And as brave as it has been to kill Ironman, it was really a bit forced, although the only thing I managed to sacrifice was to avoid the salvation of the universe. I will analyze the advantage and cons.Pros:-Give more years of life to humanity before it destroys itself.-They managed to complete their goal.Cons:-To condemn humanity.-Leave his wife a widow.-Let your daughter an orphan.- Wreck the work of a visionary.-Kill oneself.But the point is that the greatest hero of Marvel was sacrificed, the man who created Ultron, the man who caused the civil war between his companions and then locked them in, the man who created all those marvel villains like the Vulture , Mystery, Mandarin, etc. But hey, goodbye Ironman.So and I have two questions for marvel lovers. How is it possible for a human being to create a gauntlet that supports the gems of infinity, when Infinity War told us that only a certain metal made by certain dwarves can do it? The only conclusion I reach is that Tony is a god or a celestial being. I also understand that if he is a god, he would be Ojo de Alcon, since he is in a moment of the movie he grabs a gem of the infinite with his hand and in guardians of the galaxy I learned that only a celestial or a god can grab the gems without dying, and in this movie, Ojo de alcon grabs it and nothing happens, so I understand that this man is a god or a celestial. Do not?Â Something that I admire about this movie is that it is very good lying, to this I mean that it is so good lying that it made half the world believe that it is the best film not only of the year, not only of the genre of Super-heroes, but of the best movies in history, they are good lying that with the jokes, the characters, the fights and all those colors of this movie, it covers all those plot holes and makes people believe that it is an almost perfect movie, so it is of Men recognize that this movie cheated the world and almost fooled me.In conclusion Avengers Endgame is a very good movie lying, with a great final battle, and with many plot holes, I just want to say that I found it very difficult to put the rating on this movie, it was between 4 to 6, but then I decided that This is only a 6/10, even though deep down in my heart I know it deserves less.",CAST#PERFORMANCE,Negative

"Brilliant from RDJ and Tom Holland, the rest was a garbled mess of retconning, time travel idiocy, regression for major characters Thor and Captain America, and embarrassing ""woke"" moments that have no place in a serious film. Wasted film time that should have been severely cut were such ""gems"" as the cringeworthy ""feminist"" group shot on the battlefield and the tedious, woefully miscast ""Valkyrie"" absurdly becoming King of Asgard - way to trash both Thor's character and any respect towards the actual, existing European cultures that are the source of these myths Marvel loves to profit from. It could have been so much better. Tragically wasted characters are the excellent Scarlet Witch and Bucky Barnes.

Stark character is so complete I just hope when the money significantly drops he isn't time travelled back into the universe. The time travel hopping was a little boring and hope nothing gets undone as it will takes away what actually did happen. RIP MCU. I enjoyed the ride and what a ride.

'Avengers Endgame' has people claiming its the greatest film of all time but its so far from that. Endgames acting is pretty good for the most part and the actors make do with an inconsistant screenplay. The score is excellent and probably the greatest part of the film. But the Russo Brothers direction is just fine and lots of the shots need to breathe or take there time to unfold. The story is poorly paced and slogs its way into an averagely ham fisted time travel plot. Before throwing out all development and making way for a dirty cgi slugfest. If you have seen any superhero movie in your life this is no different there is nothing here you haven't seen before. This is mediocre blockbuster entertainment at its worst.,DIRECTING#PERFORMANCE,Negative

Hmmm time travel........  Seriously time travel... The writers had the opportunity to make something great and they used time travel that is like the ultimate lazy writing.  Also we didnt learn why the Hulk acted the way he did i mean come on all that buildup and then we get Professor Hulk with the only explanation being Banner subjected himself to more radiation.  The last 20 min had a really epic battle scene and Robert Downey jr had some amazing scenes butnon the whole i think this movie was a massive let down from what everyone expected,CAST#PERFORMANCE,Negative
Avengers Endgame a a Visual stunning movie but the story was not as stunning as i hoped it would be. The lowest part of the story is how Ant-Man got out of the quantum realm with the mouse/rat.The time heist felt stretched out to not having any real purpose when they could have went back before Thanos snapped the stones away. I think they should've added a small villain for them to race against. I also feel like Thor and Professor Hulk had no purpose other than being a comedy relief. I also think they could've been fixed showing that they've grown as a character.,CAST#PERFORMANCE,Negative
"More than anything, Avengers: Endgame is an experience. It's the culmination of more than 20 films all piled together and somehow, it just works.Don't get me wrong, this film isn't perfect. It has its shortcomings; especially in the way it utilizes time travel and in the messy and confusing conclusion to Steve's arc. And personally, I believe these movies as a whole over utilize CGI. But this epic cape flick never really lets you think twice about those things while watching. The raw emotion it draws driven by the incredible performances on top of the well produced, intense action, all keep you focused in consistently. I thoroughly enjoyed both of my viewings and am excited to see where they could possibly go next.",CAST#PERFORMANCE,Positive
"A well made, yet flawed, follow-up to Infinity War. I thought Robert Downey Jr. gave an Oscar-worthy performance as Tony Stark, and I thought the final act of the film more than made up for its slow start. I didn't like the Fat Thor concept, I didn't think his depression should have been played as humorous. I thought the ""girl power"" scene during the final battle was forced and cringey, especially after the far better one they had in Infinity War. I also didn't like that they turned Thanos into a typical villain after the depth he had in Infinity War. Overall, I felt like this film was a good finish for what was started with the MCU in 2008, but should have been the better film over the greatness of Infinity War.",CAST#PERFORMANCE,Negative
"The way the Russo brothers manage to blend so many characters and so many plot details is so impressive and the fact that it managed to please so many people show just how much they love and care about the MCU. To start with the characters, iron man's arc is finally complete and it's so satisfying as a fan of the franchise for over 10 years. Captain America also has a great ending to his character, although personally i would have liked to see the shield go to Bucky. Even just small things like spiderman reuniting with iron man is so good and made me smile every time I watched it. The only problem there is is that the final battle between the avengers and thanos' army lacks any sort of meaning or weight, and just seems to be in there just so they could fit in an epic final battle and include character moments.

"The way that the Russo Brothers built up they hype and the anticipation for this film was mental to see, and did they pull it off... well that's a easy answer..... YES THEY DID!!! For me I like Endgame more than Infinity War, so this makes it my favourite MCU movie to date. The way that they delivered on everything is just spectacular to see on the screen. The 3hr runtime doesn't feel like it's dragging on at times which was important for the storytelling, and yes this one is more focus on the story than the action it self... but that 3rd act is the best 3rd act in a superhero movie ever. The fan service that the Russos placed in that 3rd along at times with the piece of music ""Portals"" will always give me goosebumps every time. ""Portals"" is one of the best pieces of music ever in a film. Hands down! Although this is a slow built up film. Everything that the MCU had placed beforehand, Endgame made sure to tie up all the loose ends and to tie up the all the stories involving the main set of characters. This is also very emotional film, as 3 of the main characters get the best send off that we could have wished for.... the most emotional one was (SPOILER) Tony's Death and the funeral that took place straight after the final battle when its quiet and have all the people that has been part of Tony's life in one way or another is just fantastic to see, and it did bring a few tears to my eyes.... steve's send off is another great moment as he has (SPOILER) gone back in time to spend his life with Peggy and when he came back to the present as a old man, giving his Shield to Sam. People biggest complain with Endgame is the whole Thor storyline, but in fact, I don't really have any problems with it what so ever.",CAST#PERFORMANCE,Positive
"*WARNING SPOILERS AHEAD*21 movies, 6 Infinity Stones, 14,000,605 outcomes and only 1 ENDGAME !! In my book, leading into Avengers:Endgame Joe & Anthony Russo are 3/3 in the MCU; and they continue their perfect streak- giving us a well-crafted film to cap off the Infinity Saga. The Russos always find the perfect balance of humor; but also the feeling of real threat. They seem to effortlessly juggle the challenges of a massive star cast. Finding the right words when making this review is impossible.I can't accurately capture how well they've done this film but the phrase ""Wrapped up perfect with a bow on it"" comes to mind. They've pulled off something I thought was impossible. Over the last 11 years, I have watched every single MCU film & every foundation film and they are all honored in so many ways. Looking back will make you laugh, cry & just sit back in awe that you've been apart of this journey; through this incredible cinematic world. My standouts of the film are the original 6- Ironman, Captain America, Thor, Black-Widow, Hawkeye, & The Hulk. They are all legends of this universe & we are reminded of why we love them all, like family, every second of the film. Now at this point of the review we're going enter major SPOILERS!! The many magical moments in this film are unlimited; and yes, I said magical because, that's just purely what they are. First off, going back to the Russos paying homage to all the films- these moments are blended perfectly into the film. During the time heist, we go back to the Battle of New York, Asgard, Vormir, Morag, Sanctum Sanctorum under the ancient ones guard etc. I could not believe how incredibly they structured this time jump through MCU history into the film and have it all fit without feeling overloaded. Next, killing Thanos in the opening minutes of the film was genius. I totally didnt see that coming. Every audience I sat with, the 3 times I've gone to see it, had their jaws on the ground. Moving onto Fat Thor ! It was very controversial and not everyone liked it - myself included, at first. But in the third act, when the lightning forms around Thor, and he weilds Mjolnir & Stormbreaker and his hair in in braids- I was all in. He looked like a badass Viking ?????? Then it led to the Trinity Vs. A fully Battle Armored Thanos - the showdown I craved most. Leading to the Nerdgasm moment of Cap finally wielding Mjolnir ! ????This was totally unexpected but man when it happened everyone went nuts and my heart was pounding out of my chest !! Then, watching Cap battle Thanos wielding both the shield and hammer was incredible !! How he utilized both the hammer & shield together in battle was absolutely stunning. NOW !!! THE PORTALS SCENE !! This will go down not only as iconic in comic book movies but also as one of the most Iconic moments in Cinematic History. The culmination of 10 years of the Marvel Cinematic Universe on full display!! Every beloved character together, as one, facing down Thanos' army; ready to Avenge the World ; with,Alan Silvestri's score blaring in the background. We witness Captain America for the first time finally say.....AVENGERS ASSEMBLE !! ??????????????????????????????The goosebumps were so bad my skin hurt !! I could not believe what I was seeing in front of me, it was literally something out of dream. Absolutely legendary ! Now to the end, wielding the Nano Gauntlet bracing before the fatal snap we hear Tony Stark's last words ""And I......am Iron-Man."" ""Heartbreaking"" is not a strong enough word to explain the impact of the scene that follows. Watching Tony's loved ones watch him fade into peace. We say goodbye to the Legend of the MCU Robert Downey Jr. (As Tony Stark/Iron-Man). But it wasn't over just yet, another arc comes to a close, and that is Chris Evans (as Steve Rogers). Like I said before the Russos nail it. Cap going back in time to be with Peggy was a perfect ending to the Steve Rogers character, it wrapped poetically beautiful. Flaws of the film- dont get me wrong there are many plot holes but I wouldn't fix them because that takes away the incredible scenes we were given instead. Overall, I know I'm missing so much stuff I want to spill out about this film but to sum up this review (if thats possible to do) this may in fact be the best comic book movie of All-Time !! So many elements back this statement up, not just from MCU fans but comic fans as well. It is wrapped up in one Epic, Amazing, Incredible Conclusion to the Infinity Saga !! I am proud to be a Nerd & to Disney, The Godfather Kevin Feige, & Stan Lee you have forever changed the cinematic universe. I am honored to be apart of this Incredible journey that started in 2008 to.........THE ENDGAME !!!!",PERFOMANCE#GENERAL,Positive
"The climatic end to a 11 year journey called the Infinity Saga, comes to a close. Anthony and Joe Russo to phenomenal job at executing a story that involved more than 20 other storylines from other movies and using over 50 characters. This movie was no small order for the directors. There are a lot of great moments in this film, especially in the third act, which has one of the best comic book fights scenes I've ever seen. Chris Evans as Captain America and Robert Downey Jr. as Iron Man are the highlight characters. The only complaint was that there was some SJW moments that inserted that didn't feel right. Overall it's been one of the better Marvel films in the last 2 years.",PERFOMANCE#GENERAL,Positive
"Avengers endgame was ok, Endgame had some absoloutely great moments like (spoilers) like when cap got Thors hammer, The last 30 minutes, Black widows death, The bit at the beginning with Cap in the meeting with the snap survivors.Now lets get onto the bad. I mayebe one of the only people who disliked smart hulk because he was no longer the hulk as he only smashed one thing. One other thing i disliked was Fat thor as he was played off as a joke because he was truly suffering as he felt like he had failed and every thing was his fault. The other thinh that i hated was Thanos is arc in this movie as all he wanted to do was destroy the Avengers and kill them all instead od him having depth and charachter he was just a big cgi villain that wanted to destroy the avengers.The biggest son in this film was when my man Korg played bloody FORTNITE",CAST#PERFORMANCE,Positive
It's such an amazing movie. It's a great conclusion for the Infinity War Saga and Tony's Stark's story. It's a great way to to start a new chapter with new heroes,CAST#PERFORMANCE,Positive
"You go to the hall with such high expectation from the movie (especially after the amazing Infinity War), but Endgame disappointed majorly. After creating a superpowerful villain in  Thanos, it fails to show anything new for his downfall. The superheroes are just collated together, not giving them any role or space to show individual strength. Could have been so much more glorious, al little more mysterious.",CAST#PERFORMANCE,Negative
"Sure the final fight with Thanos is more than epic, but I expected more than that. I wanted substance and a plot that didn't rely on ""quantum"" for all the questions and explanations.",CAST#PERFORMANCE,Negative
"This is my 100th post since I started this website, and that is ironic because I will be reviewing one of the most important movies of my lifetime with it. What is there to say though? After 22 movies, 11 years, and billions of dollars later, Marvel ended this saga with as good a movie as you can possibly ask for.  Every fan out there has invested so much time, money, and heart into these characters and the Russo Brothers, Kevin Feige, and the rest of the Marvel Machine delivered in a big way. The scale of this movie will never be matched and it only could have truly been felt if you have been there since the beginning.These movies have meant so much to me since they started in 2008. I was a sophomore in high school when Iron Man came out and now I am out of college for 4 years and engaged. I grew up with these movies and it was so incredibly satisfying to sit in the theater, tears streaming down my face watching everything come together.Marvel changed movie making and the way we look at movies as a whole. I am just flabbergasted by the fact that they pulled this off. So here we go I am diving deep into Endgame here, so again be aware of spoilers!!This movie was basically divided into three parts, oh and conveniently it is 3 hours so each part takes about an hour. The first hour is dealing with fallout from Infinity War, and building the team and plan to undo it. The second hour is the Avengers in teams of two time traveling through the history of the MCU to find the infinity stones, and the third hour is bringing everyone back and finishing Thanos once and for all. Each hour is incredible and brings different emotions to the table, there is legitimately a moment to laugh and cry about every ten minutes throughout each section of this movie. I will say though the second hour overall is some of the best work in Marvel history.The reward for all Marvel fans is in those scenes when they travel back through the MCU and add to each and every character that they already built on. We get moments with Tony and his dad, Cap and Peggy Carter, Thor and his mom, and numerous more situations that make you feel nostalgia and excitement all at the same time (MORE STAN LEE!). Every scene has a new surprise that again will make you laugh, cry, cheer and every other emotion you can possibly have.I want to try and do something different here because Stock Watch does not really work with this, so I will just run through the characters and talk about what they mean to me and to the movie.Tony Stark/Iron Man Â– The Heart and Soul of the series which will truly miss him now that he is (spoiler alert) dead! Iron Man 1 started the entire Universe and if it were not for the tone Robert Downey Jr. set and commitment he had to the movies, they would not be here today. His relationship with every single character was important and meaningful and he will be truly missed. Watching him snap his fingers to I AM IRON MAN was about as emotional as it gets.Steve Rogers/Captain America Â– The Leader of the Avengers and the man delivering the positive messages throughout the series. Chris Evans has been fantastic throughout the saga, but he was particularly good in this. He really got to show a range of acting skills and had the two best moments of this movie. When he got to hold Thor's Hammer my crowd went Bananas, and when every hero emerges and he finally gets to say AVENGERS ASSEMBLE, the tears were streaming down my face and it might have been my favorite moment in cinematic history. His send off was perfect and passing the torch to Sam felt right.THOR! Â– Thor started out in the MCU as more of a Shakespearean figure but has turned into easily the funniest main character in the Universe. His entrance to Wakanda was ICONIC, but his treatment in this movie was so unexpected and perfect that I will remember it forever. They make him a fat Fortnite playing slob that has forgotten what it means to be The God of Thunder. His road back and redemption is great and basically every word Chris Hemsworth says throughout the movie is hysterical.Bruce Banner/Hulk Â– This character actually started out with Edward Norton playing Bruce in The Incredible Hulk, but they cast Mark Ruffalo for the Avengers and have not looked back. He has done a great job balancing the Bruce Banner role with the craziness of the Hulk, however in this he gets to do something totally different. He has become Professor Hulk which is the Hulk with Bruce's Brain. This is one of the best Marvel gags ever and gives Ruffalo a chance to shine. He was hilarious and gave us a completely unique look at the character which is not easy to do 22 movies in.Clint Barton/Hawkeye/Ronin and Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow Â– These two have been linked together really since the original Avengers. They are the only heroes without ""powers"" and they always had an unspoken sexual tension between them on some level. They both had very emotional arcs culminating on Vormir where in order to get the Soul stone one of them needed to sacrifice themselves. They have an epic fight where both are trying to kill themselves, ultimately finishing with Black Widow dying for good. This was one of the best scenes in the movie and puts a stamp on one of the ancillary relationships in the Avengers.Scott Lang/Ant Man Â– At the end of Ant Man and the Wasp, Ant Man was trapped in the Quantum Realm, meaning he missed all the events of Infinity War. So, the beginning of Endgame has him figuring out what happened and then finding the Avengers to try and figure out how to make a ""time machine."" He has so many funny moments playing the audience avatar of sorts and really has been an awesome addition to the MCU.Nebula Â– Nebula was a character introduced in Guardians of the Galaxy as a daughter of Thanos. She did not have much personality and was honestly built to be a killer. Over time she has blossomed, but never really was given a chance to shine. Here in Endgame she becomes sort of the key to the whole story, which just shows the power of the Marvel brand and these characters. Karen Gillan did a great job and I really enjoyed all of my time with her.War Machine/Rocket Raccoon Â– Not much to say about these two, they had a few hysterical lines and heartfelt moments but did not add too much to the overall story. I do enjoy their presences in the MCU though.All of the other ""snapped"" Characters (Black Panther, Spidey, Scarlet Witch, the rest of the Guardians and the numerous others) are in the movie later on and do not play a huge role in the story. Same with Captain Marvel, she is there only when they need her and then she flies away. These will all be the stars of the franchise moving forward though. So we will be seeing plenty more of them.What else can you say about this movie honestly? The Russo Brothers have done an unbelievable job with the 4 movies they did and accomplished everything a comic book fan can dream of. Kevin Feige had incredible vision and foresight that led to, in my opinion, the greatest cinematic achievement of all time.*A couple other tidbits- I loved how we hear Sam in Cap's ear to signal everyone coming back, it is a chills inducing moment that only Marvel can produce.- KORRGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG (if you know, you know)- The scene where all the women in the Universe get together is pointed, but very awesome.Juice Rating: 96/100",PERFOMANCE#GENERAL,Positive
"Endgame really is a perfect ending to the Infinity Saga (with FFH serving as an epilogue). Somehow, the Russo brothers have done it again, making a film starring 20 heroes work, though their cast has been snapped in half. Downey and Evans shine in their iconic roles and Scarlett Johansson has her best performance yet as Black Widow. The final battle is simply amazing.",PERFOMANCE#GENERAL,Positive
"Needed more Dr. Strange action! Felt like the final fight scene with Thanos could've been choreographed a lot better especially when you have a magic caster who could dish out different spells like Dr. Strange. But alas, he was instead given the duty of holding off the impending doom from crashing down on his team.",CAST#PERFORMANCE,Positive
"Although not as good as Infinity War, this was a terrific movie!  I found it to be a very worthy conclusion to the MCU.  It was very well written and had top notch action sequences and special effects. I especially enjoyed the way they wrapped up Tony Stark  and Captain America's stories.  Although I found ""Fat"" Thor to be funny at first, I think that bit dragged on a little too long. I really wish Thor could've returned to his normal form during the course of the film. Also I'm not sure the inclusion of Captain Marvel really did anything to make the movie better.  Aside from those couple grips, the rest of the movie was fantastic with some of the best action I've ever seen in a film. Highly recommend.",CAST#PERFORMANCE,Positive
"In this movie, Thor is an obese, drunken, buffoon.  He is, not the god of thunder, but the god Falstaff whose antics, although funny, are full of sound & fury, signify nothing, and embarrassingly provoke a desire to shut him up rather than listen to him.  This movie is like that.  Although I respect what this crew has created over the last eleven years and appreciate the fun cinema they have produced, I stand with Mssrs. Scorcese & Coppola, this was quite a let down.  There were some good moments esp. from Robert Djr, Chris Evans, Scarlet J, & Mark Ruffalo.  Paul Rudd and Don Cheadle also gave fine performances for what they were worth. The cinematography was dazzling, colorful, and quite the carnival ride.  The CGI was very well done.  But they ruined the story - or rather, bungled it - and in bungling lost a great opportunity for real cinema.  First, It seemed as though they were unclear about what tone they wanted to strike.  Had they chosen a somber story about loss, sorrow, and recovery - that would have been great.  Had they chosen a story about bouncing back with humor and silliness that would have been acceptable.  Heck, even a story about getting the bad guy and kicking purple heinie would have been something.  Instead, they chose all three resulting in a lack of focus as to whether laughter, sorrow, pathos, or anger was the appropriate response.  Furthermore, instead of focusing on the story of one character they tried to tell the story of every character in the universe - and so failed.  First we were sympathizing with Hawkeye (portrayed brilliantly by Jeremy Renner who seems like he needs his own badass movie), then we sympathize with Iron Man (whose loss is visually apparent in his horribly emaciated frame and manic frustration), then we sympathize with Black Widow, then Thor, then Hulk, then... and so on.  There is never a moment where we can say ""Ah, this is the protagonist"" b/c there is no first sufferer.  Even in ""Civil War"" the protagonist was the Avengers itself fighting internally.  Here the focus was so screwy it was as though the director had a handheld camera and was moving frantically from character not sure whom to focus on.  Third, they betrayed the sacrifice made in the prior film with a cheap Deus Ex Machina.  At the end of ""Infinity War"" the MCU had the potential for an epic of real loss and human emotion.  But at the end of this movie not only does the cavalry/god appear to save the world from being overrun by CGI monstrosities, but those same monstrosities are done away with by the snap of a glaved finger.  Even though the finger is attached to the arm of Tony Stark who dies b/c of it (sorry, spoiler!), his loss doesn't have impact due to the gigantic nature of the CGI battle that has just ensued.  (Whenever HOLLYWIERD tries to solve its movie problem with a CGI battle we are due for epic failure; Wonder Woman, BvS, Justice League, Far from Home).  Moreover, bringing back all these glistening characters in the nick of time - untraumatized and revving for battle - simply seems cheap and lazy; almost comic.  How for instance did one of the billions of other organics snuffed out by Thanos NOT get caught up in that group of heroes when Dr. Strange rallied them for their Gandalf & Rohan Rider Return?  (Imagine being that shlub; alongside SpiderMan, Hulk, Thor, and Captain Marvel comes Larry Putz!  ""What the blitzen?  I'm supposed to be in Jersey!""  and wouldn't there also be dogs and cats and birds and bugs and stuff?  Wasn't it one half of ALL living creatures?  parameciums and bacteria?)  Further what they represented, namely the men and women on this earth who have died trying to keep others safe, cannot come back again.  Ever.  And perhaps there in lies my greatest dissatisfaction with this movie.  It didn't really think through what it was saying about human life.  The crew, pandering to the drooling fanbase, seemed to be  going for glitz, noise, eye-popping spectacle and the chance to ogle each and every character in slow motion or sinuous lingering strolls with the camera as they stand in little groups of black, mourning their fallen comrade.  This mania to show every single character in the universe had the predictable effect of lessening the efforts of some of the greater actors (Cumberbatch, Boseman, and Holland were wasted on this movie) and magnifying even more how some of the actors/characters should never even have been introduced; even the little bits Brie Larsen had in this film were nauseatingly excessive, whilst Saldana, Gillan, and Olsen were hardly seen at all, and not to effect.  Though I admit it was good to see Tilda Swinton revising her role as the Ancient One, there was only the slightest nod to Bautista's great character, Drax, and what the heck happened to Loki?  The point being that in order to sell more action figures at Target the studio chose to bring in every character and make them super.  But when everyone is super... nobody is.  The studio gave thought only to selling product and not nearly enough thought on how to conclude the problem they had set up for the last eleven years.  Had they really given thought to what the story was saying (in almost every movie up to this point) they would have heeded Thanos (played by Josh Brolin whose efforts were a highlight of this otherwise solely commercial enterprise) who delivers one of the better lines in the movie saying, ""You couldn't live with your own failure. Where did that bring you? Back to me.""  Thanos is a brick wall.  He represents the one inevitable impediment that no one, no matter how powerful, can ever overcome.  His very name, Thanos, represents this - he is death, and the problem set up in this series of entertaining movies was whether having super powers could allow you to avoid death.  It cannot.  But accepting that, or dealing with that, constitutes the quintessential human problem.  No one here gets out alive.  Had the movie focused on the various responses to life's inevitable failure, had they set up a dilemma for Tony Stark between two major responses to death, that would have approached real epic status.  I can envision Tony having to choose between Cap's keep on trying to win with power and optimism attitude (""I can do this all day"") vs. an angry, seething, violent Thor (rather than a fat, pussy, videogame drunkard Thor) hell bent on revenge but no Thanos against whom to revenge (the line ""you took everything from me"" given to him and not Scarlet Witch); trying to outthink the problem and realizing (coached by the astral bodied Dr. Strange) that the only way out was self-sacrifice - that would have been intense.Instead the studio chose cheap product and big profits over real story telling; loud cheering for the polythene heroes over deep introspection and mourning for the real human loss; glossy popcorn entertainment over actual artwork.  They created a legacy over eleven years that verged upon the epic but, having created it, failed to follow through and end it at the last.  Like Thor, they flashed in the pan, made some noise, and ended limpingly, overswollen, drunk, and futilely fizzling.  But, then again, they achieved a 97% at Tomatoes and raked in a ton of cash so... win, right?",CAST#PERFORMANCE,Negative
"Avengers Endgame has quickly risen as the highest grossing movie of all time. It has quickly become one of my favorite movies. After twenty-one movies and ten long years, the world is finally saved and safe from its biggest threat. This movie was the perfect ending to this saga, yet strong enough to stand alone. Even though the movie is a three hour stretch, it's worth every bit of your time. I was on the edge of my seat and wouldn't even let myself take a bathroom break. I absolutely love how every one of the marvel characters we able to interact and meet each other. The way their storylines tied up was pleasing for me. I waited with anticipation for their paths to cross and once they did, I literally cheered. My favorite part of the movie was when the characters time traveled back to the original Avenger's Movie. It helped me remember some important points, and it was fun to see how much the characters have evolved since then. I feel that this movie had everything in it that I could have asked from the characters. Tony Stark was finally blessed with a child, and I got to see a more human side of him. Natasha Romanoff sacrificed her life to save the world and acquire the soul stone, therefore clearing the red in her ledger. No stone was left upturned in this movie, and every character received the noble ending that they truly deserved. Clint was reunited with his wife and two children. Thor has found a new home along the Guardians of the Galaxy, and Steve Rogers was reunited with the love of his life. Even though the movie meant a tragic end for Iron Man and The Black Widow, they went out as heroes. This movie was definitely one to remember, and worth the title of best movie ever.",CAST#PERFORMANCE,Positive

Thanos has retired to grow crops and rest knowing his form of 'social justice for the universe' has been completed. wiping out half of all living life may well have given space enough for the rest to expand and grow, but it has also caused havoc to a universe relying on that half to bring order to society. Power cuts, food shortages and social disarray have left Earth and the rest of the universe bewildered and dismembered. Many are searching for their loved ones and this also has caused a divide in the remaining Avengers who mourne their losses.a way forward is found and we begin a journey to redeem the lives lost.

Thanos was probably the most fleshed-out character we have ever seen in an MCU film, he has a reason for wiping out half of the universe. But in this, he is a ruthless cold-blooded killer, who decides to instead murder everything. He went from wanting to save our future, to wanting to destroy it.

I might watch it again in the future, but it's not the type of movie I am dying to see again.",CAST#PERFORMANCE,Negative

"WHY is this movie getting so much praise? WHY are people calling this a masterpiece? It's not bad but it's not that great either. Nothing about this screams MASTERPIECE. Far from it. You would think they would put a lot of effort into this movie since this is the final Avengers movie, at least for a while then they'll make another one probably to squeeze more money out of people. This movie decides to go with the cliche time travel story which can be cool when they go through past MCU timelines but it gets annoying. The comedy in this movie is so damn overused too, not very realistic that half the population is gone and everyone is making stupid jokes instead of acting depressed. Sure you can say they do that to cope with their emotions but ffs does it really need to be used that much? This a superhero movie for crying out loud, try to be serious for one minute. I would be fine if there were a couple jokes here and there like in Infinity War but this is just annoying and ruins the entire movie for me. Fat Thor was some of the best things about the film and it seems he's really the only character that really let himself go while everyone else seems and looks the same. This movie is NOTHING like what was shown in the trailers. The trailers made the movie look serious and very depressing but no it was just a comedy film with some time travel mixed in. This movie was a major dissapointment and is very overrated and very over hyped. It seems this movie gets more praise then masterpieces like Joker and Infinity War and that sucks.",CAST#PERFORMANCE,Negative
"A great ending to the whole whizbang Avengers movies (at least, this incarnation of it!) I really really enjoyed some of the story arcs this presented (especially with Ant Man and Hulk). The final battle got a little weary after a while though, and the epilogue seemed to drag for a bit too long. But still, a great movie, and may be the best thing I've seen this year.",CAST#PERFORMANCE,Positive

Best Film Ever. 3000/10. What an amazing conclusion of the Infinity Saga. So many great moments. The pacing is phenomenal. The Russos did a wonderful job. The Final Battle sequence blew my mind.,DIRECTING#PERFORMANCE,Positive
Like every MCU movie it makes choices that I really don't like or get (Fat Thor in this one). Some of the jokes don't completely land and some moments just feel (once again) forced.  Luckily Avengers Endgame has more than enough redeeming qualities to make up for that. It offers a satisfying ending for the story that has been told over the last decade and i can't wait to see where it goes from here. Avengers Endgame may not be a perfect movie but it's definitely epic.,CAST#PERFORMANCE,Positive
"I was amazed how good this was!  I'm not a big MCU fan, but this one was filled with humanity---these folks had empathy and love...and they pulled out the big guns with the female members who often are overlooked and became the biggest, baddest heroes of the final end fight!As a woman I was proud of my lady colleagues.  Don't mess with a guy who has a wife  and children!  ""Most feared in the jungle"" is mom and her baby cubs.  Tony Stark died after finally meeting his dad.",CAST#PERFORMANCE,Positive
"I'm somewhat biased as I grew up reading Marvel comics but for me Endgame Â– the culmination of the 21 Marvel films before it Â– is a sublime movie experience. It deals with it's subject matter with a great affection and has the perfect amount of sentimentality, comedy, action and exposition to make it's run time of 3 hours not seem long enough. The story arc of it's protagonists such as Captain America and Iron Man from their first solo films to Endgame is a work of ingenious planning and ultimately fulfilling. It's a bit embarrassing but this is only film to ever make me shout out with joy during a cinematic experience. To quote the great Stan Lee ""Excelsior"" Â– but I don't see how any superhero film can hope to reach greater heights than this.",CAST#PERFORMANCE,Positive
"If you love the Avengers world and characters I'm sure you'll enjoy this. However, for me it was pretty dull for the most part. 3 hrs for no good reason as the first half is just them moping about with little action. What they did to the Hulk and Thor characters was ridiculous. It's not a spoiler to say there's a half decent battle in there, although it looks like a video game. I liked the Avengers films but that's enough of it now. I'm still happy to see more from Spiderman, Guardians of The Galaxy and Black Panther but kinda bored with the rest of them. This is an ok film to pass the time but it's no great loss if you never get round to it.",CAST#PERFORMANCE,Positive
"I didn't love it as much as other people, but that third act saved the movie from me completely hating it. The time travel stuff was kind of wonky. They spend all this time setting up the time stone as this big crazy stone with multiple movies (Dr. Strange, etc) and then Iron Man just simply figures out Time Travel. Meh. Solid concept, solid execution.",CAST#PERFORMANCE,Positive
"The Russo brothers have created a masterpiece that ties all of the previous stories, characters, and relationships together in an epic, absolutely satisfying conclusion.",DIRECTING#PERFORMANCE,Positive
"The cold open with Clint's family was crazy effective. I had wondered how long it would take me to cry while watching this film. The answer? About a minute-thirty. Time travel is tricky to do well, and some people think of it as cop-out. But we all had to know on some level that's where it was headed, right? Or at least maybe I was just hoping that because it seemed like the only way.I loved Thor's arc in this, it would have been perfect if there were fewer times it was played for jokes. I can't quite say how happy I was that we didn't see a workout montage set to Led Zeppelin. Hemsworth should probably create one, just for fun, but in terms of Thor's character and the journey he was on, it wasn't necessary.Some characters got great endings while others did not get the justice they deserved. Even still, I give this 5 stars. Making all these stories and all these characters come together was no easy feat. My expectations were sky-high and they were met.",CAST#PERFORMANCE,Positive
"This film was an epic conclusion to the infinity saga. From the epic climatic battle to the tearful sacrifices. This film is the closet a comic book film has come to being perfect. The Russo Brothers made the wait well worth it for such an incredible film.

"While some call this a masterpiece and others think it's only decent and saved by the finale, I am in between these two groups. While I was entertained by many scenes before the final act like those with time travel, I do feel that there are some major flaws. Some flaws are the slow pacing in the beginning, the lack of character development for the heroes and Thanos, the unfortunate focus on the bland Nebula, and the last 15 minutes after the final battle that really drag. I feel that 2/3 of this movie is Marvel at its finest while the rest is mediocre. I don't hate anything about this film which is why it warrants a 9 out o 10, but the flaws keep it from being Marvel's best work.",CAST#PERFORMANCE,Negative

"Having lost someone close to me with the simultaneous mixture of long and drawn out and extremely quickly as certain diseases will do; I found Avengers Endgame difficult to watch but only because it was beautiful and painful.There are two ways to enjoy this movie, one as a fun time heist, throwback, exciting blockbuster with some snappy oneliners and a healthy dose of gloss, the closure of some main character arcs and some significant resolution (although also with a heady dose of sequel potential of course.). The other way to view this movie is a movie in touch with the heart of grief and loss, and also just losing. It's deeply sad throughout and people try to put a brave face on as you do, but grief is no slouch and it clearly takes constant work for them all just to buck up and rally around another one of sad-faced Captain America's many speeches. It all culminates in the death of Iron Man and the eventual death of Captain America and both men get what they want. Lives without all this pain; The burden of responsibility and honour. When Stark dies it's quick but it feels earned, and when Potts leans in to him and allows him to go, he doesn't register anything on his face because he's dying. But you hope he registers it somewhere before he does. I'd need to see it again to appreciate the nuances and the Easter eggs but I was profoundly moved by watching these people (characters) we know well by now, in the kinds of pain we will all go through. And strangely it overtook my experience of the movie but not in a bad way. So I gave it 5 stars. When I wash it clean from my mind and watch it again. I'll be able to assess its many levels, achievements and flaws. But as a film about loss. It's superbly layered and surprisingly effective and therefore I say it's pretty much succeeded on a human level. For something with a massive green dude in spectacles and fat Thor in it, that's saying something.",CAST#PERFORMANCE,Positive
"This movie honestly bored me, It didn't fulfil my expectations. Infinity war was a lot better in my opinion. The final battle really sucked because nothing really happens at all. You could have removed Thanos his army and nothing would've really changed. And I personally really hate Captain Marvel in this movie.I also think that Thanos isn't as interesting as in Infinity War, I understand that Infinity War was the movie where they were really focussing on Thanos but in Endgame Thanos isn't as interesting.",CAST#PERFORMANCE,Negative
"The best movie in the MCU. It took all the build up from the last 11 years of the MCU and delivered one of the most epic, emotional and crowd-pleasing movies that Marvel has made. No characters feel underutilised, the time-heist is entertaining and has tons of MCU callbacks and Professor Hulk is a great change up for the character. The final battle is one of my favourite scenes in any movie as it takes all the characters we know and love (including Howard the Duck!) into one epic finale against one of the most iconic movie villains ever. Fat Thor is frustrating and Thanos does become very underdeveloped compared to Infinity War, but neither of these complaints really bother me that much. Endgame is incredible!",CAST#PERFORMANCE,Positive
"You simply can't introduce time travel in the Final Episode. You can't undo all the deaths as if they were nothing; I did read a book about the history of Marvel comics where Stan Lee wanted to sell the illusion of change and while this is exactly that. I'm allowed to jot like the core idea of what Stan Lee wanted from Marvel. I side more with Jack Kirby on wanting my movies with real irreversible changes.In some interview they tried to explain away the plotholes with the infamous phrase: ""A wizard did it"" from the Xhena parody Q&A from the Simpsons Tree House of Horror's Halloween episode.When it comes to Marvel crossover conclusions involving time travel; X-men Days of Future Past (specially the eXtentded Rogue Cut) is better than this. Also the Back to the Future this movie jokes about and tries to homage; is a thousand years better than this, Avengers Endgame is the Jaws XXII that Back to the Future II joked would happen in the future.Marvel has not only jumped the Shark; it has jumped the Fonzy as shown by the prequel Captain Marvel showing a fight on space above Fonzy merchandise. I don't understand why people aren't angry. But as someone who likes grounded movies i didn't liked this.The way time travel is done; it tries to survive on nostalgia rather than earning a good story. I didn't liked most of the uneven MCU prequels; so this feels unearned. Also the Hawkeye kids would of had been better orphan, than raised by a Punisher turned vengeful bloody cold killer Hawkeye father. The film sacrificed; and that's the thing, characters never face consequences. We never see what they learned, they just win because they had time-travel but they never overcome their personal flaws on the way the adult-kids from IT do (without overcoming any specific flaws; all characters are interchangeable and that makes the movie worse).The worse example of characters not learning anything is Captain America, even if one simpatizes with him missing his girl that got away. Creating an alternative timeline to be with her is creepy and unethical; specially because she had already aged and died of natural causes; after having a life of her own. Is wrong, also I mean they altered some timelines which is wrong. Normal time travel mechanics would had been better. I don't know it feels like they won by cheating, because they won without personal growing up and maturing if feels unearned and hollow (Star Wars III: Revenge of the Sith failure in comparison to the victory in VI: Return of the Jedi a great example of overcoming flaws and winning, even if JJ Abrams is such a bad writet that IX:Rise of Skywalker has the characters winning by doing the exact same things deemed as failures in the previous movies).2019 was a year of lackluster endings; part of the problem of reviving characters is that the ""death"" always feels fake. The positive thing I can say is the acting is good, the MCU VFX designs have always been to cartoonish for my taste; even if the effects are good. I would say too much CGI. The worst part is that the generic debris was so generic that action was hard to follow; hard to know where anyone was standing and thus what was happening.I feel that the criticized Godzilla King of the Monster handled the envioremental storyline, which I feel should had been the core of this movie; so much better. The population measure control there is Godzilla and the deaths are permanent; accepted and the villian wins because the enviorement is shown less contaminated where Godzilla attacked. Godzilla justified the villian attack by saying human overpopulation causes contamination; whereas Thanos motivations get lost due to this Sequel forgetting them completely and turning him into a generic villian.",PERFOMANCE#GENERAL,Negative
"I don't know how to feel about this movie at all! On one hand, I really liked Steve's story and ending, him passing the shield to Sam, Tony's death was wonderfully done, Ant-Man was entertaining as usual. I also really liked all the Time Travel stuff, which was really cool and made total sense to me. But on the other hand, there were so many things I hated. Bucky being snubbed, Thanos in general sucked, the ""girl squad"" moment, all of Rhodey's jokes, Captain Marvel showing up to save everyone, everything that happened to Thor... It's all just really bad and really good. I can't make up my mind.",CAST#PERFORMANCE,Negative

"It had good graphics, and there were a few parts that were really good. Natasha's sacrifice being one of them. But there were soooo many things wrong with the conclusion to a decades worth of movies. Smart!Hulk was the dumbest choice they ever made. They could have made it cool, but instead, chose to make him basically worthless. Playing off Thor's depression as a joke was crass and uncalled for. The girl power moment was not empowering, it felt forced. Steve's ending was a complete setback to his character development. Gay Joe Russo??? Really??? I'm supposed to be impressed that they included a gay character for 30 seconds and it was Joe Russo? Yeah, not impressed. Bucky getting an itsy bitsy amount of screentime. Antman was funny, as always. Tony's death was touching, even though he's my least favorite character for a lot of reasons. Overall, would I watch this again? My answer is a definitive no. There were more things wrong with this movie than there were right. I'm pretending the last ten minutes didn't happen. That Captain America didn't turn into a selfish jerk and go back to the past, forcing Peggy to choose him. He still could have retired without resorting to running away. The best thing to come out of this movie is the Falcon and Winter Soldier television show. Will never see anything by the Russo brothers again because of how bad they screwed up so many characters.",PERFOMANCE#GENERAL,Negative

I felt like they moved a little too fast to get Thanos to earth on the other hand they started the movie off too slow to make room for Miss Marvels entrance.

"A fantastic conclusion to ten years of these unique act-packed films. The Russo brothers once again bring an epic showdown with our favorite heroes. The movie isn't necessarily a cult classic what with it breaking box office records and what not, but wrapping up ten years of relatable, colorful, and well-directed action films is certainly something to go for. It's hard telling exactly what will happen next when it comes to the future success of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, but it's likely not going to top the current momentum for a while, if ever. Overall, the film has a fairly complex yet understandable storyline and is pretty unpredictable at times. It should remain quite a classic to MCU fans like myself and not just Marvel fans in general (i.e. comic books, Stan Lee, etc.).",PERFOMANCE#GENERAL,Positive
"Endgame is the culmination of the Infinity Saga's 10 year run of MCU films. It's a massive film, filled with amazing visual effects, tons of fan service, great action sequences, and a terrific sendoff for a beloved character. 'I am Iron Man' will forever be immortalized as the most badass superhero moment in the entire MCU, bar none. Once again, the Russo brothers did a fantastic job balancing tone throughout the film. Despite the gloom that completely enveloped the first 30 minutes or so of the film, they managed to add in a few lighthearted moments that set the stage for future tonal shifts in the film. I felt the humor was welcomed and, at times, downright hilarious. Steve Rogers v. Steve Rogers is a moment most soon won't forget. And that is most definitely America's ass (trademark). However, though the fan service was excellent, it severely detracts from the re-watch potential of the film. I was surprised, elated, and emotionally fulfilled from my first watch-through and the countless fan service moments will never have that same impact upon re-watching the movie (which is why I will likely never watch it again). The emotional moments were fully earned and I cried in the theater (it was the cheeseburger line), something that rarely happens to me. After 10 years of watching these characters grow and interact with one another, I felt that the arcs for Tony and Steve were perfect in every which way. Also, I'm proud to say that I predicted the final shots of the film between Peggy and Steve and I still get chills thinking about it. The Russo brothers created the perfect culminating film for the MCU but unfortunately, the over-abundance of fan-service makes this an impossible film to enjoy more than once and for me, detracts from the overall score. Nevertheless, this is still a great MCU film and the Russos have more than earned their rest.",PERFOMANCE#GENERAL,Positive

"I absolutely love this movie it is one of my favorites. I love the character of Iron Man that Marvel has created and the journey that he has been through to get to this moment and the end. It is my favorite ending in all of cinema it paid off the most of any movie in my opinion because he has had such a journey from the first Iron Man and in the scene when he talks to Yinsen he says ""Don't waste your life"" and he follows that from Iron Man to Endgame and he lives by that rule.I love the special effects every effect looks so lifelike and Thanos even the wrinkles in on his forehead look lifelike and they move like they would if they were real. I loved the score in the movie and I wish it got nominated for best score at the Oscars the score just elevates the movie and in one very important scene, in the end, it plays and it just makes it so much better. One thing people never talk about when they are talking about marvel movies is the acting I think they had some pretty good performances in this movie and I wouldn't mind if RDJ got nominated but he didn't I'm not complaining though. They make each character pay off in the end like Black Widow, Captain America, and Iron Man most of all. They just bring us through this journey with them and we get to see what they have become and what they do. This is one of the movies besides Logan and Infinity War that I have cried in and that really makes this movie so much better. And there are some WOAH moments in this movie that even after watching it twice still WOW me. I think that the story is very good it kept me on the edge of my seat wanting to learn more about their plan and how they are going to execute it, it is three hours long run but I never felt like it was too long or it dragged and if someone does it still is very enjoyable. You could say they didn't do the time travel part well but time travel it very tricky and confusing in many movies it would be hard to try and explain time travel but I think they did the time travel part well to the best of their abilities. Overall I absolutely loved this movie and I would recommend it to anyone.??%",CAST#PERFORMANCE,Positive

"Everyone raved about Endgame I felt like someone standing on the side devoid of any emotions wondering ""what is wrong with me?"" ... Don't get me wrong. I liked the film, and loved Infinity War. But I thought the direction it took was disappointing. This obsession with a great massive battle is what ruined it for me. Why does Marvel insist on epic battles now? It never started out that way. Ironman was perfect in that it was a small internal strife to deal with (btw, the whole plot of Ironman is that other nations will try and build their own battle armour but after 20 years they still haven't?) The shouldn't have pulled Thanos into the current timeline like they did. I like that he was mixed in some how, but it should have been subtle event. The whole closed time line scenario is brilliant. I was was happy. It's rare for a show to get time travel right. There are only a few directions one can correctly follow, and Avenger's started that so well. But than they had to have Thanos come through. Maybe it would've been interesting if it was just a handful of them and the reset returned him memory-less, but the entire ship and army? ... I'm sorry but this looses stars. The individual story arcs were fantastic. I realise there was no way to adequately follow them all. But the ones they did focus on were fantastic.

"There's nothing original about Avengers: Endgame, but you have to give praise to the Russo brothers for once again leading this film into a smooth blended mixture of conflict, unity, nostalgic, unique humour and tearful reunions and goodbyes.Picking up where infinity war left off, the film is steadily constructed into a unique masterpiece, one major moment highlight the resolved conflict between Tony Stark and Steve Rogers, but another of hawkeye's assassin lifestyle after losing his family.The moment after five years when they reunite, you can they tell the surviving avengers are about to risk it all and that is the last time for the avengers to assemble.A new adaptation of hulk gave a fresher feel into the movie, Thor's depression has transformed into somewhat a broken yet hilarious creation who grieves after failing to save everyone but hoping he's still worthy.The most prominiment moment is Scott describing 2012 Steve' suit as Â‘America's Ass'A moment that will not be forgotten and which every avenger contributed to all the emotions leading up to this.It's a rare movie in which just when you think everything is resolved, Ebdgame proves you wrong and throws the next surprise. This is expressed when all the disappeared avengers come back to fight against Thanos's army, in which the final moment which Steve gives the Â‘Avengers Assemble' charging into the final chilling moments of the rest of the movie.The most shattering finale reveals Tony Stark taking the sacrifice to save everyone. In what started the MCU with Robert Downley Jr's iron man, it's the final moment in which tugs our heartstrings that the Tony Stark we knew has ultimately overcomes his fear and his comfort to pull off the greatest emotional moment in MCU or perhaps of the decade.Overall, one of the best.

"Avengers End Game the 23rd movie in the MCU ( Marvel Cinematic universe) bring you an exciting, joyful, funny and heartbreaking movie. While almost 11 years of making movies this movie bring the best ending you can think, also new openings to the next movies. Endgame begins with a reminder of what was lost in the previous film. The movie starts off with moments after Infinity war,  showing us the avenger, not in the last one Hawkeye and shows us what he loses. The Movie continues to a shot in outer space showing us a lost spaceship and showing us how the lost avengers came back to earth. Then they show how nothing could be changed. Then Five years later Ant-Man comes back shocking the Avengers with an idea which gives the heroes the lost hope. They re-assemble the team with the help of tony stark. They accomplish the goal and gain what is needed. Then it leads to an astonishing battle with all the heroes vs the villains army where the special effects are through the roof. You get everything you ever wished for in this battle. Then it ends with an epic plot twist and sadness.    This movie is easily a 9.3/10 it a tremendous movie with a lot of work put into it and came out to be a terrific movie making about 7.1 billion dollars making the second most amount a movie has made at the box office. This movie is the perfect movie has all the things humor, adventure, sci-fi. It also has many easter eggs only the comic book readers would get. This movie shows how one comic book made by Stan Lee was much more, it was the whole universe.",WRITING#PERFORMANCE,Positive
"Every movie leading to Endgame successfully met the requirement to have a decent plot only for Endgame to create a shamble. Despite Rotten Tomatoes giving it a generous approval rating, it was honestly at best a 2/10. I don't even know where to begin but here is a list of a couple of issues I had *SPOILERS*: No grieve/connection with the death of Tony Stark as the movie proceeded to direct its attention back to Captain America The killing of Thanos early on in the film and the introduction of one from a different timeline who did not know anything that happened in Infinity War left a sour taste in my mouth. Even if it was necessary, it was a swift and emotionless death. It was from then that I knew this movie would not be so great. What exactly was the purpose of Captian Marvel? Her standalone movie (I felt) did pretty well and I expected her to have a bigger purpose in Infinity War but all she really did was save Tony Stark -> Dipped -> returned to destroy Thanos ship? I would say some of the bright spots I saw throughout the movie was the character development of Ant-man and Nebula as well as the aminations towards the fight scene(s). Nebula I felt was a very important factor towards making sure the 'New Thanos' understands what happened in Infinity War. Without her, this would have been a total shitshow.",CAST#PERFORMANCE,Negative
"Despite the fact that they were super heroes the movie displayed the very essence of the human nature in their characters.  Thanos was all about what was right for a perfect universe.  The Avengers displayed what was good for it.  Might may be right but only for singular conquests.  The Avengers showed that goodness will conquer all.  They all could have chosen to keep what they had and ignore the rest, as we humans a lot of times choose to do, but what makes them super is that they choose to sacrifice and to serve, especially Iron Man.  I thought the movie was great.  Didnt go into it looking for flaws, rather the opposite went into it looking for something good and it was there.  Do the same.  Be inspired.",CAST#PERFORMANCE,Positive
The best movie. Sad Tony Stark dies,CAST#PERFORMANCE,Positive
Incredible ending to a fantastic saga of over 10 years.  The Russo brothers pulled off a great feat and challenge to handle such an amazing cast of stars.,DIRECTING#PERFORMANCE,Positive
"Endgame gives chills throughout the whole movie, and will give you ton of great acting from Robert Downey. Jr and Chris Evans.The only downfall of the movie is the Confusing Time Traveling",CAST#PERFORMANCE,Positive
Quite possibly the best movie I've seen all year to this point. The Russo brothers and every MCU actor have quite possibly given the best performances of their respective careers with this film.,DIRECTING#PERFORMANCE,Positive
